I'd love to talk to you about your experience, since you're a bit ahead of me in the process. Would you be open to a skype/phone/chat conversation? 

Also, would you mind sharing the rhet/comp digital diss list that Kathie Gossett mentioned in one of this post's tweets? I'm in rhet/comp and I'd LOVE to see what's being done!

		<title>Five Tips for Getting Started on a Digital Humanities Dissertation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/?s=Five+Tips+for+Getting+Started+on+a+Digital+Humanities+Dissertation"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3192" alt="Logo for DHnow Resource Post" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DHnowResource.jpg" width="100" height="100" /></a>
As you might have noticed from this blog and my tweets, I'm in the opening act of what promises to be <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dh-the-dissertation-literature-style" target="_blank">an exciting and non-traditional doctoral literature dissertation</a> [<em>auathor's note:</em> I'm now writing the dissertation; <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/digital-dissertation" target="_blank">read more here!</a>]. I'll be blogging the actual content of the dissertation in the months to come, but for now I'd like to share some of the things that have helped me mediate between my digital and humanist goals:
<ol>
	<li>At the beginning of writing the prospectus, identify all roles that have advisory and/or control relationships to the final form of your dissertation, and <strong>ask them to acknowledge in writing the conditions under which they will accept the dissertation format you propose</strong>. I talked with our library’s digital repository (which ingests dissertations), the graduate school (which has final say in granting my degree), my graduate department (to help them understand how my dissertation format choice is good both for me and for the department), and my dissertation committee (of course!).</li>
	<li><strong>Generate a monthly schedule for completing both the digital work (coding, metadata, whatever) and writing for your project.</strong> <strong>Have options in place</strong> in case a) coding takes longer than planned and/or b) you need to make changes from the code you originally planned to create (e.g. it’s too hard to do or someone else does it first).</li>
</ol>
[caption id="attachment_912" align="alignright" width="326"]<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Amanda-last-of-the-snow.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-912 " title="Ozymandias of snowballs" alt="Photo of last melting snowball bearing a sign quoting the final lines of Shelley's &quot;Ozymandias&quot;" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Amanda-last-of-the-snow.jpg" width="326" height="244" /></a> I hope these tips help you get your DH dissertation snowball rolling, rather than melting in Shellyian despair (Photo is CC Zero by Amanda Visconti, from the University of Michigan Law Quad, Winter 2008/9)[/caption]
<ol>
	<li>With all the members of your dissertation committee, <strong>hold a meeting that is focused on practical aspects of your dissertation’s running and marketing</strong> (both to non-DH members of your department and the larger community). You’ll likely need to do some extra work over a traditional dissertation’s requirements to justify the format of your dissertation and how it fits into your degree program (in my case, literature); <strong>this is actually a really helpful, mindful exercise that I think all students should do whether or not they’re producing digital work</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Plan towards eventual publication of your work</strong>, considering both traditional venues and more recent projects that can handle both writing and new media projects. If you’ll be blogging as part of the process, consider how this writing can become part of the finished project, whether it can be republished, and the risks and rewards of early publication. Think about how the nature of what you can publish out of your dissertation will affect your job prospects (e.g. students seeking tenure-track teaching positions need to think carefully if they’re not creating something very book-like).</li>
	<li><strong>Be clear on your career goals and what skills you’d like to improve over the coming years of your dissertation</strong>, and <strong>identify who will be supporting the more technological aspects of your project</strong>. How can you use your dissertation to develop and demonstrate these skills? Think not just about improving existing skills or honing one ability, but about diversifying your skills.</li>
</ol>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[DH evaluation! I wrote my <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/si.umich.edu">iSchool</a> <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/71380">master’s thesis</a> on evaluating and serving audiences for digital humanities archives (<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/71380">full text available here</a>; my advisor was Professor Paul Conway), and my nascent Ph.D. dissertation will incorporate user testing of my own digital literary code as well as suggest some best practices for DH user testing on a limited budget. Given this background, I’ll be publishing for the next <del>three</del> four days on user testing, an area of evaluation that foregrounds the user--the use, usefulness, and usability of your digital work for a given audience. It's my hope to make each of these posts applicable to people working on small budgets and/or on their own. The posts in this series are:
<ol>
	<li>Wednesday, October 31st: <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/quickdirtydhusertesting" target="_blank"><strong>Quick and Dirty DH User Testing</strong></a></li>
	<li>Thursday, November 1st: <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/amateurinthearchive1" target="_blank"><strong>The Amateur in the Archive: Toward a Wider Audience for Your DH Project</strong></a></li>
	<li>Friday, November 2nd: <a title="DH User Testing: What’s Been Done? (Adding to a Growing List of Resources)" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dhusertestlist" target="_blank"><strong>DH User Testing: What’s Been Done? (Adding to a Growing List)</strong></a></li>
	<li>Saturday, November 3rd: <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/the3us" target="_blank"><strong>Testing</strong><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.08296723710373044"> DH Sites: More on Use, Usability, and Usefulness</strong></a></li>
</ol>
The posts cover "quick and dirty", practical ways of making your DH project more user-aware; an argument for designing DH projects that serve not only scholars, but also a wider, public-DH audience of "amateurs"; a description of a use study run on amateur users of digital humanities archives; existing examples of DH user testing by researchers from different backgrounds, on different types of audiences; and choicemaking about evaluating use, usefulness, or usability for your DH work.

Let’s start extremely practical: <strong>what we can do in a single day towards user testing our own small-scale DH tools and projects?</strong>

[caption id="attachment_956" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/affinitywall.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-956" title="affinitywall" alt="Photo of affinity diagram on wall made of post-it notes" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/affinitywall-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a> To know the affinity diagram is to fear it! Although it's a useful assessment tool, I'll be recommending some kinder ways of evaluating how your DH project treats its audience. (Photo by author's contextual inquiry team, Fall 2009)[/caption]
<h2>1. Analytics! Analytics! Analytics! (Know Thy Audience)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">[pullquote]Who’s interested in what pages of your site, and what kind of technological needs do they have for accessing your content?[/pullquote]Even if you have no funding and only an hour of free time, I cannot see any reason for not installing <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> on your DH project website (or your blog or portfolio, for that matter). Google Analytics tracks visitors to your site and gives you information like your site’s busiest days of the week, how long visitors are spending on any given page, whether your readers are using mobile devices to access your site, and where in the world your visitors are from. All this is not only fascinating and flattering (<em>neat! people are looking at your work!</em>), but it helps you build a better website and project by giving you some free information on who’s interested in what pages of your site, and what kind of technological needs they have for accessing your content.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Drop me a comment if you'd enjoy a post on setting up and generating custom reports with Google Analytics to find out who’s using your DH website and how. It’s pretty easy to set up, though (but generating customized reports is a bit tricky): on any site, you can insert some lines of code the <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> site will give you to start tracking; if you’re running Wordpress (WP), this is even easier: behold, the <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/google-analytics-for-wordpress">Google Analytics plugin</a>! (On WP, you’ve probably also got the nifty Jetpack statistics running, which provide less powerful but still useful analyses of your site users than Google Analytics.)</p>

<h2>2. What Do You Want to Study About Your Users?</h2>
If your time and money is limited, it might help to separate out <strong>what you most care about studying about your audience</strong>:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Usability:</strong> Can your site <em>be used</em> as you intend? Is it difficult to navigate or to understand how the content is presented? To assess usability, you might give a set of readers the same task to achieve through your site (e.g. “Tell me about how and why James Joyce’s drafts look different at different stages of writing”) and observe the time and steps each reader takes to provide you with an answer.</li>
	<li><strong>[pullquote]In a study headed by Jan Spyridakis, researchers found that ease of retention of visually-accessed knowledge often meant... bad usability![/pullquote]Good Usability or Bad Usability</strong>?: In a study headed by Jan Spyridakis ((Spyridakis et al. "<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/details" target="_blank">Using structural cues to guide readers on the internet</a>". Information Design Journal 15(3), 242–259)), researchers found that ease of retention of visually-accessed knowledge often meant... bad usability! Design that interrupts narrative flow, exercises working memory, and forces readers to establish context all served to better retention of information. When trying to apply understandings of the reading brain to DH project design, we really need to understand more about humanities-specific reading (i.e. long texts and research reading patterns). As we design for research and learning, we need to ask ourselves whether we are aiming at use or usability--do we want the user to go our way or their way? Are there ways to make these more compatible ends?</li>
	<li><strong>Use:</strong> <em>How</em> are people using your site--as intended, or for other ends? Using a tool like Google Analytics is a start toward knowing who’s using your stuff, but to go beyond demographics and what pages are getting visited, you’ll need to think about a tactic like soliciting use stories from site visitors.</li>
	<li><strong>Usefulness:</strong> If your site can be used as intended (usability), is it <em>actually helping</em> the people you’re looking to serve? A simple, quick embedded survey (e.g. from <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/www.surveymonkey.com" target="_blank">SurveyMonkey</a>, which I think gives a free upgraded version to graduate students--at least it did in 2009) can let your visitors tell you whether they found what they were looking for, had any issues with your navigation or comprehension, or would like to see something new on your site.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Build On Existing Metrics (Standards of Measurement)</h2>
Depending on what you’re studying, you don’t necessarily need to build a metric from scratch--in fact, in some cases it’s best to adapt previous work. Here’s a section from my master’s thesis on basing my metrics on other researchers’ work, with the plainspeak take-aways below:
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">The instrument [metric I used to conduct research] is a combination of pieces of <strong>two pre-existing instruments derived for research on similar topics</strong>. A study by Koohang (2004) ((Koohang, A. (2004). <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.inform.nu%2FArticles%2FVol7%2Fv7p129-141-002.pdf&amp;ei=ifOTUP69EaWH0QGlt4DoDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHojzQ0p5sdTphOqo2JVtNIjXoqJw&amp;sig2=yrsVIOFxNYk0TYfWIaQHOg" target="_blank">Expanding the Concept of Usability</a>. Informing Science Journal, 7, 129-41.)) assessed the usability of e-learning courseware with a focus on user's perceptions of the courseware's usability, <strong>much as the current</strong> study assesses learner's perceptions of digital text features and use; <strong>both Koohang's work and this study also looked at</strong> the effect of technology experience on user experience and educational success. A study by Harley et al. (2006) ((Harley, D. et al. (2006). <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcshe.berkeley.edu%2Fresearch%2Fdigitalresourcestudy%2Freport%2Fdigitalresourcestudy_final_report.pdf&amp;ei=gVOTUKfLDYSB0AG0h4GoCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNF4yhgA0uWalASwZhYpZFzx7vljIw&amp;sig2=FtcqOFVwbcQXoEgqgi4Z8Q" target="_blank">Use and Users of Digital Resources: A Focus on Undergraduate Education in the Humanities and Social Sciences</a>. Center for Studies in Higher Education.)) assessed digital resource use in the undergraduate humanities and social sciences; <strong>as with the current study</strong>, Harley's emphasized the need for user studies to empirically understand the desires of users of digital learning tools.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Likert item questions [spectrum of answers indicated by radio buttons] drew from both of the instruments used in these previous studies, as <strong>they provided a tested example of the assessment of a digital resource's user experience</strong>. The analysis of quantitative data also drew from Koohang's (2004) study; <strong>where</strong> Koohang compared years of Internet experience with assessments of e-learning courseware usability using ANOVAs, this study compared years of Internet experience and degree of experience with digital texts with the results of ten scaled-response questions assessing digital text use.</p>
</blockquote>
[pullquote]<strong>What isn’t as difficult is finding evaluation work from other domains such as education and computer science that can be useful in assessing at least your website-based work</strong>[/pullquote]I wrote my master’s thesis shortly after finding out that what I was doing was digital humanities, so I’m certain my master's thesis discussion of the lack of DH user studies misses out at least good DH evaluation work that had been done before 2009, though not for lack of searching--such work is still difficult to locate (thus, the DH Now <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/solicitating-writing-on-assessment-and-evaluation-of-dh-work">solicitation for writing on these topics</a>). What isn’t as difficult is finding evaluation work from other domains such as education and computer science that can be useful in assessing at least your website-based work (e.g. the Koohang study mentioned above, which studies perceptions of usability instead of usability). I've bolded all the parallels I drew between their studies and mine; don't forget to be clear in any public write-up you create from your testing justifying how the metrics you created/adpated were the right ones (social science papers provide some good tips on how such a write-up differs from a traditional humanities paper).

If you don’t have a lot of time or experience with user testing, finding an existing metric that applies to your questions about audience means you can spend less time worrying whether your results will say what you think they say, and more time analyzing those results when you get them. Not only is it good to not reinvent the wheel, adapting another researchers’ metric (remember to cite!) lets you read about how that metric was applied and what the results and issues with the tool were.

<em><strong>I hope these quick ideas were helpful! <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/amateurinthearchive" target="_blank">Tomorrow</a>, I'll be writing about a specific user audience that interests me: "amateur" users, aka citizen scholars or interested audience members from outside the academy/alt-ac world.</strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em><a href="http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/?s=The+Amateur+in+the+Archive%3A+Toward+a+Wider+Audience+for+Your+DH+Project"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3186" alt="Logo for DHNow Editors' Choice Post" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DHnowEditor.jpg" width="100" height="100" /></a>This is the second post in a <a title="DH Evaluation: A Three-Part Series on User Testing Your DH Work" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/3partdheval">four-part series</a> on user testing for DH projects. Yesterday, I discussed some ways of doing “<a title="Quick and Dirty DH User Testing" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/quickdirtydhusertesting" target="_blank">Quick and Dirty DH User Testing</a>”.</em>

Changing my form of communication ((...And that's any unaccustomed form. Needing to justify the code-heavy format of my Ph.D. dissertation has been a useful exercise for me, but I think it would be a useful tool for any traditional dissertator as well. As a textual scholar, I’m convinced that awareness of medium can only lead to work that more meaningfully harnesses the unique features of that form (as well as recognizes its limitations).)) reminds me of my audience. The challenges of communicating through the digital highlight the corresponding issues faced by readers of this non-traditionally presented content. My master’s thesis involved a user study evaluating the use of well-established digital humanities archives by a wider audience, a group I still refer to as “amateurs”, and it’s an awareness of this specific audience for our work that I’m discussing here.

<strong>[pullquote]“Amateurs” in the old sense of pursuits not undertaken in a professional role, but often with passion, competence, and curiosity--the humanist geek latent in all of us.[/pullquote]</strong> In terms of DH creations with advanced scholarly uses, “amateurs” as I’m defining them are a sometimes under-served group--not the relatively small circle of creators and colleagues at the center of a digital archive’s realization, but the nebulous audience just beyond that inner circle: “amateurs” in the old sense of people whose pursuits aren't undertaken in a professional role, but are followed with passion, competence, and curiosity--the humanist geek latent in all of us ((As I define amateur in an unconventionally positive way, here’s my positive definition of “geek”, courtesy of Simon Pegg: “Being a geek is all about being honest about what you enjoy and not being afraid to demonstrate that affection. It means never having to play it cool about how much you like something.")). For example, instead of assessing the <em>Blake Archive</em>’s use by it’s developer-users and other Blake scholars using the site as a primary resource for their professional work, I’m interested in users without this degree of specific content knowledge about Blake (some with overlapping knowledges, e.g. art historians, non-Romanticist literary scholars, artists and printers, and creative writers, and some with no relationship to Blake, e.g. the casual reader of poetry) and/or without the familiarity with DH commonplaces and digital archive design that make navigation and use of such sites more intuitive.

In "Collaboratively Curating Early Modern Texts", Martin Mueller argues (in the context of crowdsourcing) that this audience encompasses anyone motivated by "duty, fame, and love: the amateur scholar, the citizen scholar, and everybody else who would like to be recognized for something useful or splendid they have done”. Whether we’re seeking their assistance or making our scholarly efforts meaningful outside of the people who already have advanced knowledge in our field, the digital placement of our work means that it’s more easily accessible to more people ((But not to everyone. I'll be blogging in the future about my work as a programmer with the MITH/BrailleSC "Making the Digital Humanities Open" partnership, which will make Wordpress, Omeka, and other web content accessible via braille and screen readers)) than thirty years ago--but virtual access doesn’t mean much if new site visitors are bouncing off your archive without using it. (Check out Section 2.1 “ Two Types of Digital Text Users” in <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/71380">my master’s thesis</a> for more on types of users for digital humanities archive projects, or <a title="Quick and Dirty DH User Testing" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/quickdirtydhusertesting" target="_blank">yesterday’s post</a> on how you can tell if people aren’t staying on your DH website for more than a few second.)

(Click image for more credit info and close-ups.)[/caption]

<strong>I don’t mean to argue that every piece of DH work needs to serve a general as well as a scholarly audience.</strong> There’s much to be said (e.g. on <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/humanistica.ualberta.ca">4humanities</a>) on the worth of humanities as public service, as the preservers and curators and teachers of culture (something enjoyably expressed by Ernest Cline’s novel <em>Ready Player One</em>). On the other hand, I don’t think it unreasonable that any mid- to large-scale project should acknowledge that people will want to use their content in unexpected ways or without specialized knowledge of either the content area or DH commonplaces of form and navigation. With with everyone's limited funding, though, it’s entirely understandable why we don’t have many DH user tests or sites geared at diverse users--and that acknowledgement of these users might need to be more of a nod than a hearty welcome.

<strong>There are ways of serving a wider audience with your DH site that don’t need to take too much time or effort, and can also serve the scholars at the core of your user audience: </strong>
<ul>
	<li>tours and introductions to the site’s structure and content (e.g. the Blake Archive has a<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/index.html"> lovely tour</a> of their offerings behind the intro page),</li>
	<li>intuitive interfaces or explanations of making meaningful serendipitous discovery within a set of objects (<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/index2f.html">Uncle Tom’s Cabin and American Culture</a> does a good job at supporting browsing rather than searching; each object is contextualized on the same page), or</li>
	<li>focused teaching tools and exercises that help the reader learn to think like a scholar in your field (e.g. the Dickinson Electronic Archive’s “<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/reorder.html">Emily Dickinson Writing a Poem: Manuscript Ordering Exercise</a>”, which seems to no longer work but is a great idea).<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.08296723710373044"></strong></li>
</ul>
Digital texts (online scholarly editions, digital archives, thematic research collections, literary engagements, etc.) promise learning beyond that possible with traditional resources--new connections, serendipitous discovery, themes rising out of giant texts corpora. Purpose-built digital texts (as opposed to general-audience sites like <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/index1.html" target="_blank">the LOC’s American Memory project</a>) are crafted for specific research purposes, with developer-users and devoted academics comprising their primary, "scholar" audience--but a secondary, "amateur" audience of learners with less digital text or content experience also relies on these purpose-built resources.

[pullquote]<strong>Does the promise of new learning from digital texts extend beyond scholars to amateurs, or does the design of purpose-built digital texts, by focusing on more experienced users with direct lines of communication to digital text developers, prevent this extension of benefits?</strong>[/pullquote]In my master’s thesis user study, I asked: Does the promise of new learning from digital texts extend beyond scholars to amateurs, or does the design of purpose-built digital texts, by focusing on more experienced users with direct lines of communication to digital text developers, prevent this extension of benefits? This 2009-2010 study gauged one subgroup of amateur users' perceptions of the value of digital texts in terms of answering self-generated research queries. The participants, graduate students from the University of Michigan's information master's program, worked with a digital archive (either the Blake or Whitman project) and provided narrative and survey data assessing their experience of digital text features and perception of their learning success. An analysis of the survey data produced an introductory understanding of amateur users' perceptions of their digital text use, their design needs, and their success or failure at learning through digital texts, an understanding I hope to deepen as part of my Ph.D. dissertation work. The study gathered data about amateur-audience digital text use in three areas: general use, nature and success of research queries, and the interplay between experience with digital texts and success at achieving new knowledge. I decided to focus on digital archive <em>use</em>, assessing these resources by whether users were answering their research queries when using that resource; questions pertaining to digital text usefulness (i.e. relevance of the digital text to the amateur audience) and usability (e.g. efficacy of individual features, site structure) were avoided as outside this study's scope (<a title="Quick and Dirty DH User Testing" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/quickdirtydhusertesting" target="_blank">see yesterday’s post for more on the differences among use, usability, and usefulness in user studies</a>).

It’s important to be specific about what audience you are targeting with your using testing, as it’s important to know who is your site’s primary audience. I’m particularly interested in ways we can serve both scholars and a wider audience as public service, teaching, and for the love of sharing things we care about deeply. <a title="DH User Testing: What’s Been Done? (Adding to a Growing List of Resources)" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/dhusertestlist" target="_blank">Tomorrow</a>, I’ll discuss my experience collecting exemplars of DH evaluation and user study research for my own user study, providing some suggestions on readings and example metrics for anyone interested in testing how their digital work is being used. Meanwhile--I'd love to hear about ways you've reached out to a wider or amateur audience with your DH work!<em>

On Wednesday I discussed some ways of doing “<a title="Quick and Dirty DH User Testing" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/quickdirtydhusertesting1">Quick and Dirty DH User Testing</a>”; on Thursday, I discussed <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/amateurinthearchive" target="_blank">my work with user testing for “amateur” user audiences</a>.
</em>

Today, I'd like to share some research on DH user testing that I've found useful in my own work. These are sorted by focus and field and include some comments on the state of digital evaluation. ((I wrote my master’s thesis shortly after finding out that what I was doing was digital humanities, so the list of studies above surely misses out on some good DH evaluation work that I just wasn't aware of/didn't locate (the list also doesn't cover more recent research--something I'll remedy as I blog more about the new user study work I'm doing as part of my Ph.D. dissertation).)):

[pullquote]“We have little empirical data about how these resources are being used... the general lack of knowledge about level and quality of use... has been identified as a pressing concern.” - Harley et al.,"Use and Users of Digital Resources" ((Harley, D. et al. (2006). Use and Users of Digital Resources: A Focus on Undergraduate Education in the Humanities and Social Sciences. Center for Studies in Higher Education.))[/pullquote]
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. Studying usage patterns of digital humanities resources: </strong>The LAIRAH (Log Analysis of Internet Resources in the Arts and Humanities) Project worked directly with users to determine "factors that may predispose a digital resource to become used or neglected in the long-term" (Warwick, Terras, Huntington, &amp; Pappa, 2007) ((Warwick, C., Terras, M., Huntington, P., &amp; Pappa, N. (2008). If You Build It Will They Come? The LAIRAH Study: Quantifying the Use of Online Resources in the Arts and Humanities through Statistical Analysis of User Log Data. Literary and Linguistic Computing 23(1), pp. 85-102.)).</p>
<strong>2. Usability work geared at improving individual projects or features:</strong> Don et. al.'s 2007 work ((Don, A., Zheleva, E., Gregory, M., Tarkan, S., Auvil, L., Clement, T., Shneiderman, B., &amp; Plaisant, C. 2007.

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Who Wants to Know?</strong> Even in those studies that might benefit digital text development, the multiple agendas at play in the interpretation of digital resource user studies, from institution administrators to resource developers, may baffle those digital text creators who try to sound out their entire potential audience as to how “an exceptionally diverse set of digital resources is actually used" (Harley et al., 2006, section 1-2).</p>
<strong>Reports. </strong>Several reports found that most digital cultural collections only informally model their intended audience and have made a call for the disciplined evaluation of digital text users. These reports include<strong>

Juola (2006) ((Juola, P. (2006). Killer Applications in Digital Humanities. <em>Literary and Linguistic Computing</em>. Retrieved August 21, 2009, from http://www.mathcs.duq.edu/~juola/papers.d/killer.pdf.)) decried this lack of user studies, identifying a "mismatch of expectations between the expected needs of audience (market) for the tools and the community’s actual needs" as a likely source of much unrealized potential with digital texts (p. 5). NINCH similarly found that digital texts are often erroneously designed around assumptions about user's needs based on “existing usage of analog resources” (2003). Such assumptions ignore the new possibilities presented by digital resources: "for instance, use of postcard collections has always been limited, but when made available in digital form their use rises dramatically; ease of access is the key” (NINCH). The discovery of such new uses for digitized materials underlines the need for direct user evaluation: “only by carrying out evaluation with our users can we find out how the digital resources we create are actually being used” (NINCH).

The increasing ubiquity of the digital text is paralleled by the increasing importance of empirical evidence for the worth of these projects and for the needs of their users. Digital text developers need to formally gather feedback from amateur users, rather than developing user personae through thought experiments or relying on informal models of their needs; if it seems obvious to us that what we create is useful, we should be able to develop metrics that demonstrate this success less subjectively.

<em>I'll finish up this post series <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the3us">tomorrow</a> with some more thoughts on "Testing DH Sites: More on Use, Usability, and Usefulness".</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>This is the fourth post in a <a title="DH Evaluation: A Three-Part Series on User Testing Your DH Work" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/3partdheval2">four-part series</a> on user testing for DH projects. On Wednesday I discussed some ways of doing “<a title="Quick and Dirty DH User Testing" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/quickdirtydhusertesting2">Quick and Dirty DH User Testing</a>”, on Thursday, I discussed <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/amateurinthearchive1" target="_blank">my work with user testing for “amateur” user audiences</a>, and on Friday I shared <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/dhusertestlist1" target="_blank">some examples of DH user testing and evaluation</a> I've encountered.</em>
<p dir="ltr">John Unsworth (1997) ((Unsworth, J. (1997). Documenting the Reinvention of Text: The Importance of Failure. <em>The Journal of Electronic Publishing</em>, 3(2). Retrieved August 21, 2009, from http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=jep;view=text;rgn=main;idno=3336451.0003.201.)) argues that the benefits of hypertext (and other aspects of the digital humanities as well) need to be testable. To claim that digital texts offer benefits beyond those of print texts, digital humanists must be able to point to a theory that could potentially be disproven:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>When a theorist of hypertext does make claims of a factual nature (such as the claim that hypertext is an improvement over the state of text in printed form)... [he] has obliged himself or herself to support those claims with empirical evidence and rational argument... <strong>If we do think that we are "reinventing the text"... then we must have a theory to guide that research, and it must be possible for that theory to be proven wrong by the evidence. In short, if failure isn't a possibility, neither is discovery.</strong> (Unsworth, emphasis added)</em></p>
That digital texts offer a plethora of tools not found with traditional resources is not being debated. Whether or not these tools are actually in frequent use and benefiting their users has not received enough attention; digital humanists must assess not the quality of the digital text as an idealized resource, but its value when accessed by real scholars on a daily basis. Being so closely tied to a digital texts' development, scholar users of a digital text can quickly voice any issues with the project they are using; amateur users cannot similarly voice their needs. Thus, evaluating the value of real use by amateur digital text users is of great importance.

[pullquote]If the use value offered by digital texts in contrast to traditional resources seems obvious, then producing empirical evidence of these benefits should pose no problem—and yet very little in the way of scientifically conducted testing of digital texts has taken place.[/pullquote]Amateur audiences may form the majority of users for many digital texts, and the digital humanities world is ready for a formal evaluation of this group's needs and perceptions. If the use value offered by digital texts in contrast to traditional resources seems obvious, then producing empirical evidence of these benefits should pose no problem—and yet, as demonstrated above, very little in the way of scientifically conducted testing of digital texts has taken place. ((There are certainly good practical reasons for this--funding and time being the foremost.))

Digital humanists can remedy this lack of scientific proof of digital texts' value to users. First, <strong>digital humanists can test the structure of a digital text, examining the system that delivers resources to the user;</strong> this involves<strong> a usability approach</strong> that follows users in their functional interactions with a site's interface. Digital texts can potentially assist scholarly users with many tasks. The Summit on Digital Tools for the Humanities (2006) ((<em>Summit on Digital Tools for the Humanities</em>(Report from the September 28-30, 2005 Summit). (2006). The Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities: University of Virginia. Retrieved August 20, 2009, from http://www.iath.virginia.edu/dtsummit/SummitText.pdf.)) identified four areas where attendees believed technology could aid humanities work: "interpretation, exploration of resources, collaboration, and visualization of time, space, &amp; uncertainty" (p. 5). John Unsworth (2000) ((Unsworth, J. (2000). Scholarly Primitives: What Methods Do Humanities Researchers Have in Common, and How Might Our Tools Reflect This? (Part of a symposium on “Humanities Computing: Formal Methods, Experimental Practice” sponsored by King's College, London, May 13, 2000). Retrieved August 20, 2009, from http://www3.isrl.illinois.edu/~unsworth//Kings.5-00/primitives.html.)) provides a different list—“discovering, annotating, comparing, referring, sampling, illustrating, and representing”—as basic human activities simple or “primitive” enough to be easily transferable to humanities computing. These individual features and tools of a digital text can be tested by straightforward usability studies.

Second, digital humanists can <strong>identify the value of a digital text's content</strong> by looking at the <strong>usefulness</strong> of the content to the scholar. Such a study would test the relevance of a digital text to its proposed audience, measuring the relatedness of the material to a project's users’ research (Saracevic, 2007a, p. 1918) ((Saracevic, T. (2007a). Relevance: A Review of the Literature and a Framework for Thinking on the Notion in Information Science. Part II: Nature and Manifestations of Relevance. <em>Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology</em>, <em>58</em>(13), 1915-1933.)). Saracevic (2007b) ((Saracevic, T. (2007b). Relevance: A Review of the Literature and a Framework for Thinking on the Notion in Information Science. Part III: Behavior and Effects of Relevance. <em>Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology</em>, <em>58</em>(13), 2126-2144.)) examined relevance studies that looked at user assessments of web pages, including comments on decision-making and measures of perceived usefulness and authority (p. 2127).

Third, digital humanists can <strong>identify the value of a digital text's content</strong> by looking at an audience's<strong> use</strong> of a digital text; such a study would look at user behavior, assessing what users are trying to do with a site and how they go about doing it. A measure of use is different from a measure of usefulness; where usefulness looks to the relevance of content to an audience, evaluating use requires looking at the efficacy of a digital text after its usefulness has been established or assumed (Park, 2000, p. 461) ((Park, S. (2000). Usability, User Preferences, Effectiveness, and User Behaviors when Searching Individual and Integrated Full-Text Databases: Implications for Digital Libraries. <em>Journal of the American Society for Information Science,</em> 51(5): 456-468.)).

My master’s thesis study focused on the last of these three value assessments, use. The least well-established benefit of digital texts is not the offloading of scholarly chores, but assistance to scholars in making new inferences and connections as suggested by their personal paths through material that is "both interactive and non-linear... a non-narrative experience for the user" (Katz, 2005, p. 113) ((Katz, S. (2005). Why Technology Matters: The Humanities in the Twenty-First Century. <em>Interdisciplinary Science Reviews</em>, 30(2), 105-118.)). Judging the worth of an entire digital text—that sum greater than the tools and resources it contains—is not as easy as quantifying the efficacy of individual features and can be accomplished with neither usability or relevance studies; instead, a digital text's worth should be judged by whether users are answering their research queries when using that resource, or coming to new, unforeseen realizations. Figuring out the worth of the whole digital text, rather than its component features, requires probing scholars' perceptions of their digital text use.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.08296723710373044"> </strong><em></em>

		<title>Living Editions: What Seminars Can Teach Us About Building Digital Editions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>"In the humanities, what we produce is narrative, and that narrative comes out of experiences of reading.</strong>" <em>- <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/www.joguldi.com" target="_blank">Jo Guldi</a>, spoken comment at the <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/topicmodeling" target="_blank">Topic Modeling Workshop</a> at MITH on November 3, 2012</em>

My private shorthand for what I want to do with digital editions is "make them like a seminar".

That's not the only or best way of thinking about digital editions; for a start, editions are also conceptualized as:
<ul>
	<li>vessels for the centuries-old work of interpreting documents and what they say about the larger text they participate in,</li>
	<li>pedagogy,</li>
	<li>cultural preservation,</li>
	<li>the remixing of multiply useful documents to create new texts for research and reading,</li>
	<li>useful substitutes for artifacts you can't physically access ((Tanselle, G. Thomas. <em>A Rationale of Textual Criticism</em>.)), and</li>
	<li>a way of reading ((McGann, Jerome. "Ulysses as Postmodern Text: The Gabler Edition".<em> Criticism</em> 27.3: 1985. 283-305.)).</li>
</ul>
I try to use the phrase "digital editions" instead of "digital editing" to emphasize that I'm talking about a broader DH activity than traditional or text-level editing. These are choices of project and web design that inflect the form of the edition as a text in its own right, an interpretive, critical activity sometimes called "interfacing". "Digital edition" as meta-text to "editing"'s text, if you will. As my work is focused on our interfacing and behavior with the form of the edition (values that take concrete form with code such as CSS and PHP), I naturally gravitate toward a metaphor foregrounding the edition as a tool of <strong>communication</strong> of interpretive knowledge and connected skills, one that aspires to <strong>a wider audience of users</strong> than the traditional humanist monograph. That "wider audience of users" means that some of the approaches I'll discuss will be less aimed at seasoned scholars of a text than new readers–but many of these approaches can help provoke new knowledge for readers at any level of intimacy with a text.

So: if a digital edition can be like a seminar, what do I mean by "seminar"? I'm usually thinking about graduate seminars as these have been my best in-class experiences, but we might apply lessons from any class-like meeting where a high percentage of the learners are self-motivated and ready to contribute new learning to the class, but benefit from the content, structure, and guidance provided by the instructor. Seminar as the give-and-take opposite to lecturing's delivery and reception of information.

[pullquote]The seminar metaphor understands that one party (the instructor/editors) has a privileged position to the project and its main content areas, but that their role is not only to impart information but scaffold and accept new knowledge and intellectual contributions from the other party (the students/edition users).[/pullquote]In a digital edition, the parallel is between the edition's team of creators (editors, designers, project developers) and its audience. There's been good discussion of developing more meaningful crowd-sourcing for editions over the past few years (e.g. the Scholars' Lab's Praxis Program and their <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/about" target="_blank">Prism tool</a>, which harnesses "collective interpretive energy"), a movement away from treating our audience as students in a lecture (who mainly receive our polished work) or as free labor (for tasks that may be interesting but that require rote transcription rather than interpretive thinking and input of new ideas). The seminar metaphor understands that one party (the instructor/editors) has a privileged position to the project and its main content areas, but that their role is not only to impart information but scaffold and accept new knowledge and intellectual contributions from the other party (the students/edition users).

My last seminar before achieving candidacy was was <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/neil-fraistat" target="_blank">Dr. Neil Fraistat</a>'s <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/eng738T" target="_blank">Technoromanticism</a> ((You can read my <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/technoromanticism" target="_blank">series of posts about the class</a> or just my post about one of the times I group-taught the class <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/dissect-and-rebuild-reimagining-frankenstein-as-e-lit" target="_blank">here</a>.)), a class that I now realize was a living edition of Mary Shelley's <em>Frankenstein</em>, and that used many approaches I'd like to see in digital editions. By <strong>living edition</strong>, I want to point at not just the excellently planned <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/syllabus" target="_blank">syllabus</a>, which structured our developing conversations about whole and hacked technologies of memory and imagination, monstrosity and virtual realities, always building on previous readings and conversations–but also the class itself, students and teacher:
<h2>Five Approaches from the Technoro Seminar That Digital Editions Could Employ More Regularly:</h2>
<em><strong>1a. Seminar Experience:</strong></em> Technoro quickly had the seminar participants coming to class reporting sightings of our Romantic texts still breathing in the real world, whether that meant the image of Frankenstein's monster in <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the-colonial-subject-as-frankenstein" target="_blank">colonial attitudes toward the Irish</a>, or <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/bioshock-and-frankenstein-another-modern-prometheus" target="_blank">Nigel Lepianka's connection</a> of the videogame <em>Bioshock</em> and <em>Frankenstein</em>'s "Modern Prometheus" motif.

<em><strong>1b. Edition Take-away:</strong> </em>Explore not just your key content, but the boundaries of each text's discourse field. A digital edition that pulls in examples of the text's reception history provides the user with ways to trace themselves back to the world of its writing as well as gauge the ways a text still influences today's world.

<em><strong>2a. Seminar Experience:</strong></em> The Technoro class brought in many voices with diverse practical and theoretical relationships to course motifs such as hacking and prosthetics of memory; in addition to the core of literature Ph.D. and M.A. students, students' academic positionings included theater, creative writing, education, cognitive science, and circuitry.

<em><strong>2b. Edition Take-away:</strong>  </em>I'd like to see digital editions do a better job incorporating the diverse voices and knowledges of their users. We need better ways of moderating, categorizing, and retrieving annotations from users with many different backgrounds; one decided area of my dissertation is a plan to address this issue via coding and design work, a project currently codenamed "Infinite Ulysses" ((More on my dissertation plans soon!)). And while we're talking about diversity, let's not forget to try designing our digital editions to be universally accessible (e.g. to screen readers).

<strong><em></em><em><strong>3a. Seminar Experience:</strong></em> </strong><strong></strong>For <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/how-can-you-love-a-work-if-you-dont-know-it-six-lessons-from-team-markup" target="_blank">my Technoro group project</a>, I got to lead a group of students through learning and applying technical skills (Github for markup workflow, TEI encoding) that helped us think about the materiality and transmission history of our key text, <em>Frankenstein</em>, while learning to think like editors about page-level textual issues.

<strong><em><strong>3b. Edition Take-away:</strong></em> </strong>Don't obscure the digital structures of your meta-text (the edition framework) by only paying attention to the materiality of the text your edition surrounds. Document decisions about project development and editing methodology using accessible language, and don't efface the human realities behind this work; record both failures and triumphs. If on top of that your edition is able to teach something of how to "think like an editor" to its users, well... that's for another post, as it's a goal of one of the tools I'm building for my dissertation. (I've seen a few examples of editions trying out this possibility, such as the defunct playspace for rearranging Emily Dickinson's poems that used to be a part of the <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/www.emilydickinson.org" target="_blank"><em>Dickinson Electronic Archives</em></a>.)<em> </em>

<em><strong>4a. Seminar Experience:</strong> </em>One of Technoro's course requirements was for each participant to team-teach two class meetings. Students quickly expanded on fairly standard teaching approaches like preparing short lectures and bringing questions to class, to approaches that generated more new ideas such as thought and design experiments (e.g. <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/dissect-and-rebuild-reimagining-frankenstein-as-e-lit" target="_blank">imagining an e-lit remediations</a> of <em>Frankenstein</em>, or <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/team-2-caleb-williams-the-matrix" target="_blank">charting correspondences</a> between <em>Caleb Williams</em> and <em>The Matrix</em>); situating ourselves as masters of the material helped us become masters of it.

<em><strong>4b. Edition Take-away:</strong> </em>An important moment in the life of a graduate student is shifting one's relationship with knowledge from student to master (from mostly reception to scholarly creation). Similarly, the moment the reader of an edition shifts from simply reading the text as he would a non-scholarly edition and begins to make use of the intricacies of the form is an important one; an even bigger step is when the reader is able to contribute back to the edition. Making sure our users can do this, whether through annotation, curation, or some other method (blog posts on how they've used the edition in their own work, scholarly or otherwise?)–and modeling how to do these things well–are smart pedagogical steps.<em> </em>

<em><strong>5a. Seminar Experience:</strong> </em>Always one of my favorite parts of a class: hearing what course ideas have caught fire in other students' minds and what they plan to make of those ideas. Technoro's projects were especially interesting because they often built on team skill-building from earlier in the course, where students either learned to do basic TEI encoding for manuscript pages of <em>Frankenstein</em> or to produce and understand topic models of Gothic texts. A good seminar encourages specialization of students' research beyond the main concerns of the class and supports communication of that specialized learning through final class projects that are shared with the entire class.

<em><strong>5b. Edition Take-away:</strong></em> Every edition is a work of the editor's interpretation; every reading experience of an edition is an interpretation as well, and if you give the reader a path for communicating that interpretation she'll add to the collective pool of knowledge about a text. Similar to the previous take-away, let readers reflect their experience of the text by adding and/or curating annotations and related media–but also consider opening up your marked-up text so that users can create and submit different themes, functions, and interfaces with different interpretive resonances (more on difficulties, practical strategies, and existing work on editions as APIs in a future post).]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Monograph Writing Isn&#039;t the Only Scholarly Act: Chronicle Interview on Digital Dissertations</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was interviewed about my digital humanities/digital dissertation work by Stacey Patton at <em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em>: <a href="https://chronicle.com/article/The-Dissertation-Can-No-Longer/137215/" target="_blank">here's a link</a> and some snippets on my work:

<em>Amanda Visconti, a doctoral student in her third year at the University of Maryland at College Park, entered the graduate program in English with a background in Web development, information studies, and user testing. She hasn't yet started on her dissertation—which will be digital—but has experimented with a prototype <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/www.UlyssesUlysses.com" target="_blank">digital edition of </a><a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/www.UlyssesUlysses.com" target="_blank">Ulysses</a>, which allows users to read the novel's first two episodes with explanatory annotations and images that appear when the reader moves his or her mouse over words that might be confusing.</em>

<em><strong>"Digital editions do a lot of things, but I'm interested in making them more participatory, meaning that readers get an interactive, engaged experience instead of a passive reading experience,"</strong> Ms. Visconti says. "Producing a traditional, book-style dissertation wouldn't help me do the scholarly work I need to do. <strong>And it wouldn't present that work to others in a way they could test, use, and benefit from."</strong></em>

...

<em>Ms. Visconti, the Maryland student, says she has had to defend her decision to do a nontraditional dissertation to academics who don't seem to think that digital projects on their own are scholarly enough. Some people assume, she says, that projects like hers are just Web sites where scholarship get published electronically; those professors [i.e. people--I didn't mean to call out professors] don't seem to understand how digital work can produce new tools for analysis that allow researchers to ask new questions.</em>

<strong><em>"There is the lingering opinion that writing monographs is the only scholarly act," she says. "Other activities, such as coding, designing, scholarly editing, and experimentation, are [too often treated as] pre- or postcritical [instead of as scholarly activities]."</em></strong>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Digital= 1 of many equally valid options for dissertations; that said, not a bad idea for any diss to argue rightness of its chosen platform

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm about two months behind in sharing this, but take a look at <a href="http://www.karikraus.com/" target="_blank">Kari Kraus</a>'s blog post "<a href="http://www.karikraus.com/?p=234" target="_blank">Alt-Research for Humanities PhDs</a>" (from her MLA 2013 talk) for some interesting thoughts on bringing interdisciplinary methods of scholarship into humanities studies (if you haven't already read it). Kraus highlights the narrow but important difference between technological and methodological knowledge (what I think of as skills of building versus skills of designing approach/question pursuit); she discusses how the neglect of varied methodological experience turns some graduate degrees toward a focus on professional rather than advanced research development. For examples of methodologically innovative graduate scholarship, she discusses Rachel Donahue's great video game preservation work as well as my own dissertation research building, user testing, and presenting scholarly use cases of digital tools for participatory scholarly editions.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[How do scholars interface with digital editions of literature, and how can we improve the appearance and behavior of digital edition interfaces to not only better support current scholarly use, but predict and create new ways of reading, teaching, and learning about texts? With my literature doctoral dissertation, titled <em>“How Can You Love a Text, If You Don’t Know It?”</em> ((As you might know if you read this blog, just my favorite pro-editing quotation: "How can you love a work, if you don't know it? How can you know it, if you can't get near it? How can you get near it, without editors?" - Gary Taylor, "The Renaissance and the End of Editing", in Palimpsest: Textual Theory and the Humanities, ed. George Bornstein and Ralph G. Williams (1993), 121-50.)) <em>: Critical Code and Design toward Participatory Digital Editions</em>, I'm coding and designing scholarly tools, interfaces, and games that value:
<ul>
	<li><strong>building-as-making</strong>: instead of the traditional monograph, employ and extend theory in the form of tools that can actually empirically test that theory</li>
	<li><strong>speculative design</strong>: push our scholarly tools further by creating solutions for the future (e.g. a digital edition that attracts thousands of public participants)</li>
	<li><strong>user-testing, participatory design, and the public humanities</strong>: in the beliefs that teaching is knowing and it makes for a better world to share knowledge, build on <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/71380" target="_blank">my master's thesis user study of public use of scholarly digital archives</a> to create digital humanities tools that are useful to both scholars and lay-persons; we need to do a better job sharing our passion for the intricacies of our cultural heritage and present with the public</li>
	<li><strong>games and play</strong>: "Games are unnecessary obstacles that we choose to tackle", says games researcher Jane McGonigal--and so are difficult texts; think about games as models of critical learning behavior; build our rich history of literary play and gaming into our digital edition toolkit, thinking about <em>Ivanhoe</em>, the Oulipo, design fiction, communal storytelling, textual intervention, narrative alternate reality games, and video-game modding</li>
	<li><strong>graphesis and the whole book</strong>: grant the same acknowledgement of knowledge-containing visuals we do to our literary objects of study (e.g. Blake's image-texts) to their meta-texts (editions) by incorporating critical graphic design; dream big about conveying the whole book to remote researchers, not just linguistic content and 2D images</li>
	<li><strong>modeling reading and editing practices</strong>: if scholarly interpretation is a conversation, then model our digital editions on participatory exemplars of reading like online communities (e.g. Reddit) and the best graduate seminar experiences; teach people "how to think like an editor" to discover how editors' own theories develop</li>
	<li><strong>leveraging something old on something new</strong>: by migrating and extending a prescient Victorian edition prototype and its design values to digital space, explore the affordances, limits, and possibilities of both the print and digital pages</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr" id="internal-source-marker_0.6815654170486946">Digital editions are texts presented according to some critical ideal in digital space. We need to know more about how this scholarly form is used so that we can build sites that fully communicate and preserve literary texts, from the written word on the page to the iconic codes and materiality of the whole book, and so that we can in turn use digital editions as better platforms for inquiry into the nature of complex textual objects. <strong>I propose to build textual forms to understand them</strong>, creating three digital edition interfaces that separately explore the textual behaviors of reading, teaching, and research. One project will explore the social experience of critical <strong>reading</strong>, exploring whether a difficult Modernist text (<em></em><em>Ulysses</em>) becomes “normalized” or “diminished” by moving to the center of a public annotation, interpretation, and conversation, and how we might curate the information overload of a vibrantly active digital edition reader/commentator base. Another project treats <strong>teaching</strong> as knowing, using a gamic digital framework for the teaching of editing as a tool for tracing the development of textual scholarship theory and opinion. A third project assesses the whole use a scholar in a physical archive might make of a codex and imagines how we might use digital affordances, such as linkable metadata and 3D models, to bring a less partial simulation of the whole book to remote <strong>research</strong>ers. All three of these interface projects will be built around specific exemplar texts that push the boundaries of modeling via digital edition, texts that challenge both scholar and reader with a multiplicity of meanings (e.g. James Joyce’s notoriously multilayered <em>Ulysses</em>) or that manifestly cannot be fully communicated by current digital edition formats (e.g. the rich design of a <a title="Recovering Teena Rochfort-Smith: Complex Edition Prototype, Female Victorian Editor" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/recovering-teena-rochfort-smith-complex-edition-prototype-female-victorian-editor" target="_blank">presciently-hypertextual Victorian edition of <em>Hamlet</em></a>). By building digital edition interfaces that employ and extend current textual theory, this dissertation will advance our understanding of how a key scholarly form creates knowledge around texts.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Studying our meta-texts by building.</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Textual studies concerns itself with the study of the history, forms, and whole content (from the linguistic to the material) of texts; digital textual scholarship, as a narrower discipline, focuses specifically on the preparation of such texts for scholarly use via a digital space. To push the current research, reading, and teaching abilities of the digital edition further, we need to not just theorize on paper what needs to be changed about editions—it is necessary that we make these theorized changes to digital editions through web design and code work, then critically assess what our interventions teach us about the texts of these digital editions, the form of digital editions in general, and about literary research and teaching in digital spaces. This dissertation proposes to take a step back from the specific literary texts prepared by textual scholars—and a step forward from the purely-written theorizing of other textual studies researchers—to create tools that explore the critical efficacy and possibilities of that increasingly quintessential meta-textual form, the digital edition.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Three coding projects as scholarly experiments.</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Blake textual scholar Morris Eaves conceives of editions not just as vessels for textual content, but as “problem-solving mechanisms”; within my broader exploration of the future of digital edition interfaces, I will focus on several specific problems in the form of three digital coding projects, best expressed by my tweets from earlier today:</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Scholarly editor Gary Taylor has asked ((And I have requoted just about every month)) : “How can you love a work, if you don't know it? How can you know it, if you can't get near it? How can you get near it, without editors?” Scholarly editors are an integral part of the continuum that keeps the stories of the past available to and understood by the present—but just as important in Taylor’s formulation is the <em>you</em>, that public of not just scholars, but also readers beyond the academy whose interest keeps the humanities alive and relevant. <strong>I intend to build tools and digital editions that help everyone—textual scholars and the lay person—participate in our love for the nuances of a text’s materiality, history, and meaning.</strong> We need to rethink the structure—the look and behavior—of our most foundational form, the scholarly edition, looking to the full possibilities of the digital (and not just those that approximate traditional codex form) in order to see a more public textual studies—a textual studies that encourages participation outside of a limited circle of expertise, using games and ludic approaches, provocations to deeper thinking, visual design, and visual knowledge to share our intelligence about and passion for book studies more widely.</p>
<p dir="ltr">[pullquote]<strong>Participatory design</strong> is an approach not just centered on the scholar or just on the public, but finessing the “third space” of discussion and shared learning that exists when the two groups come into conversation[/pullquote]As researchers, we feel the urgency of a more publicly understood and useful humanities: convincing the public of our worth ties into how we are funded, but even more importantly, our ability to argue convincingly for our worth to non-specialists requires us to have an understanding of our studies so clear that it can be rendered into simple language. Teaching is knowing:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">[Nobel-Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman] prided himself on being able to devise ways to explain even the most profound ideas to beginning students. Once, I said to him, 'Dick, explain to me, so that I can understand it, why spin one-half particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics.' Sizing up his audience perfectly, Feynman said, 'I'll prepare a freshman lecture on it.' But he came back a few days later to say, 'I couldn't do it. <strong>I couldn't reduce it to the freshman level. That means we don't really understand it.</strong>' ((David L. Goodstein, in <em>Feynman's Lost Lecture: The Motion of Planets Around the Sun</em>))</p>
<p dir="ltr">Human-computer interaction, a field focused on interfaces between user and computer (including interfaces of reading and research), provides a useful approach to a humanities that simultaneously benefits the public and scholars: participatory design.<strong> Participatory design</strong> is an approach not just centered on the scholar or just on the public, but finessing the “third space” of discussion and shared learning that exists when the two groups come into conversation; results can include “challenging assumptions, learning reciprocally, and creating new ideas, which emerge through negotiation and co-creation of identities, working languages, understandings, and relationships, and polyvocal (many-voiced) dialogues across and through differences“ ((Muller, Michael J. "Participatory Design: The Third Space in HCI". In <em>The Human-Computer Interaction Handbook</em>. 1051-1068.)). When we bring the public into our scholarly conversations, everyone benefits; designing for interactive participation and pedagogy is a scholarly activity that also benefits the public.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In my participatory design approach to digital edition interfaces, <a title="Living Editions: What Seminars Can Teach Us About Building Digital Editions" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/livingeditions" target="_blank">I draw on my own positive experiences in graduate literary seminars, in the belief that we can build scholarly digital editions that model two of the most rewarding aspects of a good class</a>: communal enjoyment and communal knowledge of a text. A well-run seminar gets participants excited about the subtleties of a text, regardless of how remote its language or voice or subject matter might be from their own lives; a well-run seminar also results in everyone, teacher as well as students, gaining new insight into a literary text. As I experiment with the nature of digital editions, textual materiality, and other scholarly questions, I believe I can at the same time imagine digital editions as ideal communal spaces of literary conversation where scholars and public can learn from one another.</p>
This dissertation addresses a gap in humanities knowledge: the digital edition, like the print edition before it, is developing into a key form of scholarly textual presentation, yet the advances in the past thirty years of textual studies have mostly focused on three areas of study to the exclusion of other knowledge: the development of a standard for encoding text (the Text Encoding Initiative), the development of archives presenting well-encoded text and textual images alongside tools for searching and inspecting these (e.g. The William Blake Archive), and theorizing possibilities for textual studies in digital spaces without making major changes to digital editions in concert with these theories (e.g. Jerome McGann’s <em><a title="“Decentered and reader-oriented textualities”: Jerome McGann’s Radiant Textuality" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/decentered-and-reader-oriented-textualities-jerome-mcganns-radiant-textuality" target="_blank">Radiant Textuality</a>: Literature after the World Wide Web</em>). To fill out the first two areas of study, we need to study in real scholarly situations how that encoded text, and those powerful but now fairly standard tools, are actually used and how they might be improved; to capitalize on the third area of study, we need to build these theories into our digital editions such that their innovative arguments are obvious to new users and empirically testable via user studies. There are some very good reasons why user-awareness isn't more prevalent in DH and in digital editions in particular (e.g. funding and grant time constraints, lack of example metrics to build off), and I'll be addressing these as well as throwing in my bit of DH user studies work for the next practitioner to build on. I'll also be discussing some recent and important work innovating the interfaces of our digital editions, such as <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/www.tapasproject.org" target="_blank">the TAPAS project</a> (trying to open all that lovingly encoded text to remix and reuse for research and teaching), <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/tools-and-prototypes" target="_blank">various INKE initiatives</a> (especially Jon Saklofske's <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/8" target="_blank">NewRadial</a> work imagining new entries into the Blake Archive), and Alan Galey's <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/index.html" target="_blank">Visualizing Variation</a> code sets, all of which incorporate a laudable awareness of the broad end use and reading experience of editions.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My "Infinite <em>Ulysses</em>" project falls more on the "digital editions" than the "digital editing" side of textual scholarship; these activities of coding, designing, and modeling how we interact with (read, teach, study) scholarly editions are usefully encompassed by Bethany Nowviskie's understanding of edition "<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/interface.html" target="_blank">interfacing".</a>

Textual scholarship has always intertwined theory and practice, and over the last century, it’s become more and more common for both theory and practice to be accepted as critical activities. Arguments about which document (or eclectic patchwork of documents) best represents the ideal of a text, for example, were practically realized through editions of specific texts. As part of this theory through practice, design experiments are also a traditional part of textual scholarship, as with the typographic and spatial innovations of scholarly editor <a title="Recovering Teena Rochfort-Smith: Complex Edition Prototype, Female Victorian Editor" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/recovering-teena-rochfort-smith-complex-edition-prototype-female-victorian-editor" target="_blank">Teena Rochfort-Smith’s 1883 <em>Four-Text 'Hamlet' in Parallel Columns</em></a>.

<h2>How did we get here?</h2>
The work of McKerrow and the earlier twentieth-century New Bibliographers brought a focus to the book as an artifact that could be objectively described and situated in a history of materials and printing practices, which led to theorists such as McKenzie and McGann’s attention to the social life of the book—its publication and reception—as part of an edition’s purview. This cataloging and description eventually led to the bibliographic and especially iconic (visual, illustrative) elements of the book being set on the same level of interpretive resonance as a book’s linguistic content by scholars such as McGann, Tinkle, and Bornstein. Concurrently, Randall McLeod argued that the developing economic and technological feasibility of print facsimile editions placed a more unavoidable responsibility on editors to link their critical decisions to visual proof. Out of the bias of my web design background, my interest is in seeing not only the visual design of the texts we study, but the visual design of their meta-texts (editions) as critical—asking how the interfaces that impart our digital editing work can be as critically intertwined with that editing as Blake’s text and images were interrelated.
<h2>When is a digital object itself an argument?</h2>
Mark Sample <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/when-does-service-become-scholarship" target="_blank">has asked</a>, “When does anything—service, teaching, editing, mentoring, coding—become scholarship? My answer is simply this: a creative or intellectual act becomes scholarship when it is public and circulates in a community of peers that evaluates and builds upon it”. It isn’t whether something is written, or can be described linguistically, that determines whether critical thought went into it and scholarly utility comes out of it: it’s the appropriateness of the form to the argument, and the availability of that argument to discussion and evaluation in the scholarly community.

Editions—these works of scholarly building centered around a specific literary text, which build into materiality theories about the nature of texts and authorship—these editions we’re most familiar with are not the only way textual scholars can theorize through making. Alan Galey’s <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/index.html" target="_blank"><em>Visualizing Variation</em></a> coding project is a strong example of non-edition critical building work from a textual scholar. The <em>Visualizing Variation</em> code sets, whether on their own or applied to specific texts, are (among other things) a scholarly response to the early modern experience of reading, when spellings varied wildly and a reader was accustomed to holding multiple possible meanings for badly printed or ambiguously spelled words in her mind at the same time. By experimenting with digital means of approximating this historical experience, Galey moves theorists from discussing the fact that this different experience of texts occurred to responding to an actual participation in that experience. (The image below is a still from an example of his "Animated Variants" code, which cycles contended words such as sallied/solid/sullied so that the reader isn't biased toward one word choice by its placement in the main text.)

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/visualizingvariation.jpg" />

Galey’s experiments with animating textual variants, layering scans of marginalia from different copies of the same book into a single space, and other approaches embodied as code libraries are themselves critical arguments: “Just as an edition of a book can be a means of reifying a theory about how books should be edited, so can the creation of an experimental digital prototype be understood as conveying an argument about designing interfaces” ((Galey, Alan and Stan Ruecker. “How a Prototype Argues.” Literary and Linguistic Computing 25.4 (2010): 405-424.)). These arguments made by digital prototypes and other code and design work, importantly, are most often arguments about meta-textual-questions such as how we read and research, and how interfaces aid and shape our readings and interpretations; such arguments are actually performed by the digital object itself, while more text-centric arguments—for example, what Galey discovered about how the vagaries of early modern reading would have influenced the reception of, for example, a Middleton play—can also be made, but often need to be drawn out from the tool and written up in some form, rather than just assumed as obvious from the tool itself.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Digital humanities productions are increasingly sites of broader participation in textual interpretation, with how to evoke and harness "meaningful" crowdsourcing becoming an increasingly urgent question to scholars seeking a more public humanities.

[caption id="attachment_3113" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ulyssesfirstslide.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3113" alt="First slide from my presentation on the Infinite Ulysses project." src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ulyssesfirstslide-300x165.jpg" width="300" height="165" /></a> (CC BY-NC Amanda Visconti)[/caption]

In <a title="Building for the Great Conversation: Participatory Digital Design &amp; the Urgency of the Public Humanities" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/dhdisspublichumanities">a previous post</a>, I discussed how borrowing the HCI idea of "participatory design" can help DH practitioners and their public audiences to mutual intellectual gain. As we use the Web to open the texts we study to a wider community of discussion, bringing in diverse knowledges and interpretive biases, I’m interested in how we can usefully structure the overabundance of information proceeding from public contextual ((Contextual annotation = notes that give a context for a word, phrase, or other chunk of text, ranging from definitions of advanced vocabulary to more interpretive annotations))<strong></strong> annotation of literary texts. That is: my "Infinite <em>Ulysses</em>" project is conceived as an idealistic speculative or thought experiment: what if we build an edition and everyone shows up and adds their annotations to the text? When this quantity of voices is combined with an unusually complex text such as James Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em>, how might we create a critical experience that adeptly handles not only issues of contextual annotation <em>quantity</em> but also <em>quality</em>?

I've previously blogged about the overarching plans for my digital dissertation: about how <a title="My Digital Humanities Dissertation: Building Code, Design, and Games for Textual Knowledge and Participation" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/dhdissintro">I'm empirically testing both current and personal theories about textuality through code and design</a>, and how I'm designing this building-as-scholarship <a title="Building for the Great Conversation: Participatory Digital Design &amp; the Urgency of the Public Humanities" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/dhdisspublichumanities">towards helping everyone</a>—textual scholars and the lay person—participate in our love for the nuances of a text’s materiality, history, and meaning. This post is about the first of my dissertation's three coding projects: designing and coding an interface that allows a participatory, vibrant, contextualizing conversation around complex Modernist texts, with <em>Ulysses</em> being my main focus. Packed into one sentence, my research question for this first project is: <strong>What might we learn from crafting an interface to usefully curate quantity and quality of contextual annotation for complex Modernist digital editions (such as <em>Ulysses),</em> where the critical conversation is opened to the public?</strong> That's a long sentence covering both more abstract and more concrete critical work, and I'll be breaking it into manageable chunks with the rest of this post and those to follow.
<h2>“Infinite” annotations.</h2>
While there isn’t a complete digital edition of <em>Ulysses</em> yet published, that hasn’t kept Joycean scholars from anticipating issues that might arise with the eventual migration to digital space. Where the limitations of print space have in the past kept annotations of the text in check, what will happen when a digital platform allows the addition and navigation of infinite annotations? Can we migrate complex print hypertexts such as<em> Ulysses</em> to a digital space with socially multiplied annotations without, as Mark Marino wonders, "diminish[ing] the force of the book" ((Mark C. Marino, "Ulysses on Web 2.0: Towards a Hypermedia Parallax Engine")):
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Assuming it were possible, would the creation of a system that automatically makes available all the allusions, unravels all the riddles, and translates foreign languages normalize Joyce's text? (Marino)</p>
In <em>Joyce Effects: On Language, Theory, and History</em>, Derek Attridge similarly sees a risk in <em>Ulysses</em>' hypertextualization:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[<em>Ulysses</em>'] cultural supremacy, and the scholarly efforts which reflect and promote that supremacy, have turned it into a text that confirms us in our satisfied certainties instead of one that startles and defies is and thus opens new avenues for thought and pleasure. It now reassures us of our place in what might otherwise seem a chaotic universe, or it provides a model of coherence to take a refuge in, a satisfying structure where the details all make sense… a spurious sense of rich complexity by reducing differences and distinctions ((Derek Attridge, <em>Joyce Effects: On Language, Theory, and History</em>, 185))</p>
Yet Attridge sees space for promise in the digital development of the text as well:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The very magnitude of the encyclopedic Joycean hypertext can itself be unsettling… and it may be possible to produce a hypermedia version of <em>Ulysses</em> that is anything but reassuring—one that revives, in new ways, the provocations and disturbances of the original publication... The best teachers (like the best critics) are those who find ways to sustain the disruptive force of <em>Ulysses</em> even while they do their necessary work of explaining and demystifying ((Derek Attridge, <em>Joyce Effects: On Language, Theory, and History</em>, 186-188))</p>
Despite there being no full digital edition of <em>Ulysses</em> against which to test these fears and assumptions, we already have some questions about what happens to a complex Modernist text when “everyone shows up”, and I’m hoping that by creating a site that experiments with allowing “infinite” contextual annotation of <em>Ulysses</em> (that’s where the “Infinite <em>Ulysses</em>” title of my project comes from), we can get a more realistic picture of what extreme annotation actually does to our experience of the text. When even <em>Ulysses</em> editor Hans Walter Gabler can still learn new things about <em>Ulysses</em> ((Digital Ulysses Master Class with Hans Gabler, June 2013)) , I'm confident that Ulysses will persist as always partially unfixed, always giving back more.
<h2>Quantity and quality, signal and noise.</h2>
While the final effect of unlimited space to discuss and interpret the text remains to be seen, the "Infinite <em>Ulysses</em>" project will also tackle two more immediate problems: quality and quantity of annotation. If everyone’s submitting annotations to a digital edition, how can we automate the massive task of curation and moderation so that it occurs in a timely and unbiased manner? And once we’ve separated the wheat of critical yet diverse annotations from the chaff of repetitions, spam, and under-substantiated suggestions, how do we make the still-plentiful remaining material accessible to the users it would best serve? That is, how do we separate the signal from the noise when the “signal” of pertinent contextual annotations means different things for different reader needs?

<strong>So: what happens to a complex Modernist text when we allow "infinite" annotations on it, and how do we work with "infinite" annotations to filter, order, and display those annotations best suited to a given reader?</strong> Tomorrow's post will explain the specific features I'm coding into my interface to approach these questions.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A quick review of contextualizing and digital resources for <em>Ulysses</em> editioning, plus some notes on how I'm imagining (and limiting my imagination of) the final "Infinite <em>Ulysses"</em> digital edition.
<h2>Contextualized Joyce</h2>
[pullquote]Key print precedents for this project are variorum and other editions that deal with a large quantity of variants, marginalia, or other annotation, such as the Shelley-Godwin manuscript notebooks and Hans Gabler’s synoptic <em>Ulysses.</em>[/pullquote]My project builds on previous Joycean contextualizing work: on the print side, Blamire's <em>New Bloomsday Book</em> and Gifford's <em>Ulysses An</em><em>notated</em>, and online, the <em><a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/www.jjon.org" target="_blank">James Joyce Online Notes</a></em> and <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/open01.html" target="_blank">Michael Groden</a>'s notes and prototypes. Previous contextualizations (especially those on a higher, more macro-level of understanding the basics of <em>Ulysses</em> rather than specific allusions) carry an increased risk of authorial bias because of their individual authorship (e.g. the <em>Bloomsday Book</em> is very interested in charting Bloom's development as a Christ figure); while the sources I've named here are all excellent and useful pieces of scholarship, I'm very interested in seeing how a participatory edition apparatus moderates among a variety of higher-level contextual interpretations and whether we might thus prevent a canon of interpretation from calcifying around the text. <em>Ulysses</em> is also an interesting contextualization problem in that there are many sets of contextualizations floating around the web from both scholars and amateurs (in the old and new senses of the word); I’m interested in bringing diverse sets of interpretation together in one place and seeing how they overlap or contend with one another.

For digital projects that deal not only with annotation proper, but with how we can best display annotations for reading, check out Michael Groden's work (again), the <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/jjtm" target="_blank">James Joyce Text Machine</a>, or my 2008/2009 (dated) prototype <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/www.UlyssesUlysses1.com" target="_blank">UlyssesUlysses.com</a> (jump into reading <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/episode1.shtml" target="_blank">from here</a>; the navigation is a bit misleading).
<h2>Scholarly Precedents</h2>
Some key print precedents for this project are variorum and other editions that deal with a large quantity of variants, marginalia, or other annotation, such as the Shelley-Godwin manuscript notebooks and Hans Gabler’s synoptic <em>Ulysses</em>; these last two examples have convenient (though not-completely-realized) digital counterparts in Michael Groden’s <em>Ulysses in Hypermedia</em> prototype and the developing <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/shelley-godwin-archive" target="_blank"><em>Shelley-Godwin Archive</em></a>. I will also build on my own research into handling multiple categories of annotation begun with the 2008-2009 <em>UlyssesUlysses</em> prototype (<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/www.UlyssesUlysses1.com" target="_blank">UlyssesUlysses.com</a>), which is a dated site in terms of my technical and design abilities, but shows some of my first thinking about how we deal with the experience of accessing contextual annotations while reading.
<h2>Caveats, questions, notes</h2>
<ul>
	<li><em>Ulysses</em> is an amazing text to test the possibilities of digital edition work, but for the quality of the site's main goals (and my desire to complete my dissertation in a reasonable amount of time), interesting and important edition features such as topic modeling the episodes, or giving more than a nod and an infrequent annotation to acknowledge the growth of the text into the form readers see in front of them (i.e. presenting a versioned text), aren't planned for this phase of the project. <em></em></li>
	<li>I'll be releasing this project's code (Drupal modules, themes) on GitHub so that anyone can reuse or modify my work in their own digital edition.</li>
	<li>I'm expecting the first phase of this digital edition to emphasize pedagogy as modeling knowledge: how do we pass through the text, how do we conceptually annotate what we're reading with some degree of "certainty"? I like to think that as we create annotations and visualizations and other features with the first-time reader in mind, we’re modeling and testing our scholarly knowledge: I’ll be able to do some analysis of data on how people read and annotate the text, explore the exploded <em>Ulysses</em>, examine debates over interpretation occurring on the site, and think about best practices for interface design for the public humanities. This digital edition will best flourish with input from all levels of <em>Ulysse</em>an experience, though; a public humanities discussion isn't at its richest if it's all public, no humanists. If you're familiar with Joyce, <em>Ulysses</em>, Modernism, and/or scholarly editing and have any suggestions for how this site could develop into a tool that’s useful for scholars visiting it from the front-end (and not just for my own behind-the-scenes theorizing), please do <a title="Contact" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/contact" target="_blank">let me know</a>. Or if you don’t have suggestions for this site because you don’t think you’d use it, tell me about how you like to access contextualizing information and what tools you wish existed for locating and working with it!</li>
	<li>Can this site serve both first-time readers and scholars (people with different needs for the level of contextual annotation)? What about readers versus browsers versus searchers?</li>
	<li>Questions like the last one are what makes framing this as an experiment useful--not only do I not know the answer to these questions of scope yet, I won't know how the site breaks or elicits unintentional (organic) usage until I test it with real users. In a future post, I'll discuss some of the ways I've anticipated real versus ideal use of the site, as well as some unanswered questions about the site's use.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For my <a title="Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/infinite-ulysses-intro" target="_blank">Infinite Ulysses</a> participatory edition, I’m building a digital edition interface that allows site visitors to create and interact with a potentially high number of annotations and interpretations of Joyce's novel.

The <a title="Infinite Ulysses: Planned Features for a Participatory Edition" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/iufeatures" target="_blank">features of my site</a> draw on existing exemplars of community content submission and discussion--particularly Reddit and StackExchange, two thriving hubs of people interacting with digital text. Readers on these sites are interacting with different content than a literary edition, for the most part; the success of the mechanisms supporting those interactions is fairly text-agnostic, however, relying more on an understanding of how people interact online than what content they're interacting with.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="219"]<img alt="Photo of author James Joyce in the style of the Scumbag Steve meme" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/joycememe.png" width="219" height="268" /> Reddit isn't all memes, but here: Hey, this book isn't that difficul--oh.[/caption]

StackExchange is a group of Q&amp;A sites that match experts up with questions in a specific field of knowledge--originally computing questions, but now a diverse range of specialties including Drupal, cooking, and English language usage.

I've <a title="Memes and Meaning: Reddit for Digital Humanists" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/memes-and-meaning-reddit-for-digital-humanists">blogged about academically useful corners of Reddit</a> previously; I'll add another fascinating subreddit to the list for anyone seeking quality content on the site: <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/theoryofreddit" target="_blank">Theory of Reddit</a> (r/theoryofreddit), a space for assessing how the entire community is functioning, whether that's

	<li><a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/did_digg_make_us_the_dumb_how_have_reddit" target="_blank">graphing changes</a> in the Flesch-Kincaid reading level of comments over time since the beginning of the site, or</li>

</ul>
Theory of Reddit is a moderated/curated subreddit that defines itself as "a mildly navel-gazing space for inquiring into what makes Reddit communities work and what we in a community can do to help make it better"--in other words, an online community talking about being an online community, with the best discussion promoted to the top.

Besides the abstract use of such online community meta-cognition for participatory digital edition developers, Theory of Reddit and StackExchange have been useful in planning some specific features for Infinite Ulysses:

<strong>1. A tool becomes how its community uses it. </strong>At least partially, the usage of an online community develops organically: another fine reason for user testing and a readiness to adapt as the user community grows and changes over time. I'm fascinated with Reddit's unintentional awarding of high-visibility platforms to people who provide highly upvoted content. Users are able to edit posts after posting them; posts that make the front page (i.e. get enough upvotes to be seen by a huge number of site visitors) will usually get a small addendum on the text of the post to the effect of "wow, I made the front page"--but there's the potential (sometimes embraced) to use that editing power to expose a large number of readers to your thoughts on any subject (e.g. political activism). I like that providers of "good" content (for some meaning of good) are rewarded with more viewers; I also like the reminder that people will use a site the way that makes sense to them, oftentimes the way that is most convenient.

Although I initially anticipated Infinite Ulysses as a place where people would add contextual annotations to the novel, I quickly realized that many readers would use the annotation field to ask questions or simply mark things they don't understand. It's probably going to happen; I can't prevent it, and I wouldn't want to stop it. To build toward that realistic site usage--acknowledging that to read a difficult book is to have questions as well as answers!--I'll borrow a feature from the StackExchange sites, which provide a list of unanswered questions on the site (which you can also pull into your RSS feed). This way, Joyce junkies with a few spare minutes over lunch can pull up a question or two to answer, and I can identify points in the text in need of thicker annotation. I'll also be able to remove the questions/notes marking non-comprehension so that they don't clog the view of annotations with content, but I think it would also be useful and encouraging to first-time readers to leave some sort of simple sign behind to show that others struggled with the same point in the novel (perhaps a small icon, or a filter you can turn on to see highlighted text where questions were raised).

<strong>2. Choosing what to show near the top of a list of comments/annotation/tags isn't as easy as it seems. </strong>Reddit suffers from a problem of the quickest comments on a post often getting the most upvotes, while later good comments get lost far down the page because readers don't read far enough to assess them. Kaj Magnus Lindberg has <a href="http://www.debiki.com/-9qb49-solving-problem-first-comment-gets-all-upvotes#.UU8bHVtabV4" target="_blank">a great post on this problem</a>, where he advocates sorting not by upvotes only, but by upvotes divided by some measure of how much attention a post has received (views or time since the comment was posted). A similar issue crops up with the question of tagging annotations to allow filtering and toggling: do I define a limited vocabulary that readers can use, or allow users to create new tags? If I choose the latter, how do I deal with similar tags, misspellings, and variants? Even if I put an auto-complete option on the tagging field, the number of possible tags might become so staggering that most tags see little use, and different tagging words are created to basically tag the same thing. With both the questions of sorting comments (i.e. annotations) and wrangling tags, I'll be reading up on how other online communities have handled the problems, and I also expect to make changes to the site after I see how real users interact with these options.

<strong>3. Reputation is established by your activity on the site.</strong> To reduce the load of work on moderators, StackExchange has tiered ranges of "reputation" points awarded for different activities on the site; new users start with a reduced number of capabilities that expand the more they contribute. <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/a-theory-of-moderation" target="_blank">This 2009 post</a> on how StackExchange handles moderation emphasizes that abilities and "rep" are gained through active participation and providing content that others deem useful: "Reputation is a (very) rough measurement of how much the Stack Overflow community trusts you. Reputation is never given, it is earned by convincing other Stack Overflow users that you know what you’re talking about." With this tiered system plus giving users the ability to flag problematic content for moderator consideration, users are both able to establish credibility and reduce the load of human moderation work. I'm not sure that I'd use a similar system on Infinite Ulysses; I want to attract a diverse array of Joycean experience to the site, but I worry about creating any bar to participation or hierarchy of who's most valuable to the site. At the same time, I know that some reward for frequent contributions (a weekly top contributers? top question-answerers?) at least makes me more excited about contributing regularly to such a site. I'll definitely at least keep private tabs on frequent contributors and try to highlight their work, perhaps by posting curated sets of their annotations on the front of the site on some rotational basis.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Infinite Ulysses: Planned Features for a Participatory Edition</title>
		<link>http://www.literaturegeek.com/2013/06/25/iufeatures/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday's post introduced some of my research questions with the "<a title="Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2013/06/24/infinite-ulysses-intro/">Infinite</a> <em>Ulysses</em>" project; here, I'll outline some specific features I'll be building into the digital edition to give it participatory capabilities.

This project combines its speculative design approach with the scholarly primitive of curation (dealing with information abundance and quality and bias), imagining scholarly digital editions as popular sites of interpretation and conversation around a text. By drawing from examples of how people actually interact with text on the internet, such as on the social community <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/www.reddit.com" target="_blank">Reddit</a> and the Q&amp;A <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/stackexchange.com" target="_blank">StackExchange</a> sites, I'm creating a digital edition interface that allows site visitors to create and interact with a potentially high number of annotations and interpretations of the text.
<h2>Features</h2>
So that readers on the beta-site aren't working from a blank slate, I'll seed the site with annotations that offer a few broadly useful tags that mark advanced vocabulary, foreign languages, and references to Joyce's autobiography so that the site's ways of dealing with annotations added by other readers can be explored. Readers can also fill out optional demographic details on their account profiles that will help other readers identify people with shared interests in or levels of experience with <em>Ulysses</em>.

On top of a platform for adding annotations to edited texts, readers of the digital edition will be able to:

<strong>1. tag the annotations</strong>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For Stephen's description of Haines' raving nightmare about a black panther, a reader might add the annotation "<em>Haines' dream foreshadows the arrival of main character Leopold Bloom in the story; Bloom, a Jewish Dubliner, social misfit, and outcast from his own home, is often described as a sort of 'dark horse'</em>". This annotation can be augmented by its writer (or any subsequent reader) with tags such as "JoyceAutobiography" (for the allusions to Joyce's own experience in a similar tower), "DarkHorses" (to help track "outsider" imagery throughout the novel), and "dreams".</p>
<strong>2. toggle/filter annotations both by tags and by user accounts</strong>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Readers can either hide annotations they don't need to see (e.g. if you know Medieval Latin, hide all annotations translating it) or bring forward annotations dealing with areas of interest (e.g. if you're interested in Joyce and Catholicism)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Readers can hide annotations added by certain user accounts (perhaps you disagree with someone's interpretations, or only want to see annotations by other users that are also first-time readers of the book).</p>
<strong>3. assign weights to both other readers' accounts and individual annotations</strong>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As with Reddit, each annotation (once added to the text) can receive either one upvote or one downvote from each reader, by which the annotation's usefulness can be measured by the community, determining how often and high something appears in search results and browsing. Votes on annotations will also accrue to the reader account that authored those annotations, so that credibility of annotators can also be roughly assessed.</p>
<strong>3. cycle through less-seen and lower-ranked editorial contributions</strong>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To prevent certain annotations from never being read (a real issue unless every site visitor wishes to sit and rank every annotation!)</p>
<strong>4. track of contentious annotations</strong>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To identify and analyze material that receives an unusual amount of both up- and down-voting</p>
<strong>5. save private and public sets of annotations</strong>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Readers can curate specific sets of annotations from the entire pool of annotations, either for personal use or for public consumption. For example, a reader might curate a set of annotations that provide clues to <em>Ulysses</em>' mysteries, or track how religion is handled in the book, or represent the combined work of an undergraduate course where <em>Ulysses</em> was an assigned text.</p>
I'm expecting that the real usage of these features will not go as planned; online communities I'm studying while building this edition all have certain organic popular usages not originally intended by the site creators, and I'm excited to discover these while conducting user testing. I'll be discussing more caveats as to how these features will be realized, as well as precedents to dealing with heavy textual annotations, in a subsequent post.
<h2>First Wireframe</h2>
<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IUwireframe1.jpg" />

In the spirit of documenting an involving project, here's a quick and blurry glance at my very first wireframe of the site's reading page layout (a higher-res, readable wireframe with a walkthrough should follow in the next few weeks). I thought of this as a "kitchen sink wireframe"; that is, the point was not to create the final look of the site or to section off correct dimensions for different features, but merely to <em>represent</em> every feature I wanted to end up in the final design with some mark or symbol (e.g. up- and down-voting buttons). The plan for the final reading page is to have a central reading pane, a right sidebar where annotations can be authored and voted up or down, and a pull-out drawer to the left where readers can fiddle with various settings to customize their reading experience (readers also have the option of setting their default preferences for these features—e.g. that they never want to see annotations defining vocabulary—on their private profile pages).

I'm looking forward to finessing this layout with reader feedback toward a reading space that offers just the right balance of the annotations you want handy with a relatively quiet space in which to read the text. This project builds from the HCI research into screen layout I conducted during my master's, which produced an earlier <em>Ulysses</em> digital edition attempt of mine, the 2008/2009 <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/www.UlyssesUlysses.com" target="_blank">UlyssesUlysses.com</a>:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ulysses.jpg" />
UlyssesUlysses does some interesting things in terms of customizing the learning experience (choose which category of annotation you want visibly highlighted!) and the reading experience (mouse over difficult words and phrases to see the annotation in the sidebar, instead of reading a text thick with highlightings and footnotes). On the downside of things, it uses the Project Gutenberg e-text of <em>Ulysses</em>, HTML/CSS (no TEI or PHP), and an unpleasant color scheme (orange and brown?). I've learned much about web design, textual encoding, and <em>Ulysses</em> since that project, and it's exciting to be able to document these early steps toward a contextualized reading experience with the confidence that this next iteration will be an improvement.
<h2>Possibilities?</h2>
Because code modules already exist that allow many of these features within other contexts (e.g. upvoting), I will be able to concentrate my efforts on applying these features to editorial use and assessing user testing of this framework. I'll likely be building with the Modernist Commons editing framework, which will let me use both RDF and TEI to record relationships among contextualizing annotations; there’s an opportunity to filter and customize your reading experience along different trajectories of inquiry, for example by linking clues to the identity of Bloom’s female correspondent throughout the episodes. Once this initial set of features is in place, I’ll be able to move closer to the <em>Ulysses </em>text while users are testing and breaking my site. One of the things I hope to do at this point is some behind-the-scenes TEI conceptual encoding of the Circe episode toward visualizations to help first-time readers of the text deal with shifts between reality and various reality-fueled unrealities.
<h2>Practical Usage</h2>
Despite this project's speculative design (what if everyone wants to chip in their own annotations to <em>Ulysses</em>?), I'm also building for the reality of a less intense, but still possibly wide usage by scholars, readers, teachers, and book clubs. This dissertation is very much about not just describing, but actually making tools that identify and respond to gaps I see in the field of digital textual studies, so part of this project will be testing it with various types of reader once it’s been built, and then making changes to what I’ve built to serve the unanticipated needs of these users (<a title="DH Evaluation: A Four-Part Series on User Testing Your DH Work" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/3partdheval" target="_blank">read more about user testing for DH here</a>).

I've captured a brief tech review of the existing tools and projects that are helping me through example or incorporation:
<h3>Modernist Commons: Digital Editing in a Box</h3>
Infinite Ulysses is being built off the in-development <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/modernistcommons.ca" target="_blank">Modernist Commons</a> (MC) digital editing platform, an initiative of the <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/editingmodernism.ca" target="_blank">Editing Modernism in Canada</a> (EMiC) research group, of which I'm a doctoral fellow. MC includes the following platforms, toolkits, and digital standards:

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/?s=Digital+dissertation+deliverables+%28and+how+to+complete+them!%29"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3192" alt="Logo for DHnow Resource Post" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DHnowResource.jpg" width="100" height="100" /></a>What does a code-focused digital dissertation look like when it's done? And without chapters to divide the work ahead of you, how do you keep your doctoral research on track? I'm sharing the list of deliverables I'm creating for my dissertation, as well as some practices that have helped me keep being excited about my project and eager to continue my research.
<h3>Digital deliverables</h3>
<p dir="ltr">My dissertation is currently divided into three major coding projects ("Infinite Ulysses", "Choose Your Own Edition", and "Material Editions"; see <a title="Digital Dissertation" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/digital-dissertation" target="_blank">this post</a> for an overview or <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/infinite-ulysses" target="_blank">start here</a> for more detail on my current work on Infinite Ulysses). The coding and design in this dissertation is scholarly work exploring how digital interfaces effect our use of textual editions, so I will not be doubling this critical effort by creating the traditional monograph-length written work alongside these scholarly digital objects. There will be lots of blogging arising naturally out of the process, though, and I'll be polishing these blogs into three articles aimed at scholarly journals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since there are few if any examples of delineated digital dissertation workloads out there, I'm sharing mine both as a guide for other dissertators and as an example to show your advisor or department when attempting something similar (as this workload does come with the approval of my advisor, committee, and department as adequately fulfilling the requirements of a dissertation). My completed dissertation should consist of the following components:</p>

<ol>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">A written introduction to the entire dissertation’s methodology, research questions, theoretical grounding, and goals. Length estimated at 20 pages, with much of the theoretical discussion specific to each of the three projects held over to those projects’ individual introductions/about text on their websites. (Most of this written foundation was completed through my 18-page prospectus and early dissertation blogging, but I'll need to rework portions of that writing after all the work is done.)</p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">For each of the three coding projects, a scholarly, article-length (30-60 page) write-up aimed at future publication, drawn largely from blogging during the code, design, and testing work on each project. Each article will include:</p>

<ol>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">a literature review situating the coding project as building on a tradition of editing and literary theory</p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">a history of specific scholarly precedents in both print and digital space</p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">research questions for the project</p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">a rationale for any technical choices</p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">curated selections from academic blogging completed during the building process (to record scholarly considerations as the code progresses)</p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">results of a short quantitative and qualitative user study matching real scholars and students with the tool, plus next steps suggested by these results</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">A link to a public repository containing the code for the finished projects, as well as a sandbox website(s) where the tools can be explored in either working or prototyped form</p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">A written conclusion on the theoretical and practical successes, failures, and next steps for the overall dissertation project (length estimated at 15-30 pages)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Blogging!</h3>
Blogging twice a month splits the brunt of content generation up over the entire course of the dissertation; this regular writing also helps me generate some interest in my work, get feedback and feature requests during the initial design phase, and feel accountable to my self-imposed schedule.

In terms of getting writing done by typing small amounts regularly throughout my coding work, not having a huge stretch of writing waiting for me at the end of each project is nice, but even better, capturing what I've been thinking about during each stage of the process will render my final record more accurate (and useful to other dissertators) than trying to remember what the process felt like, where I got stuck, and when I was struck with new ideas. Because the process of critical building is as important as the product, using the blogs to set down and recognize how things are going before a final debriefing helps the entire process truly be a critical one.
<h3>Pseudo-agility</h3>
<p dir="ltr">While working on a Braille translation plugin for <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/braillesc" target="_blank">Making the Digital Humanities More Open</a>, MITH's Software Architect <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/james-smith" target="_blank">Jim Smith</a> taught me some elements of a work process drawn from <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Agile_development" target="_blank">agile software development</a> that have been a great help in organizing my dissertation work and keeping the dissertation from (thusfar) being a stressful process. One of the techniques Jim shared was a way of scheduling work that kept priorities on the top of the work pile, while also allowing breathing room, preventing late-nighters, and otherwise recognizing human limits. With my dissertation, I've applied this technique by</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>setting monthly milestones</strong> (what tasks could reasonably be done by the end of the month?);</li>
	<li><strong>prioritizing tasks</strong> by several degrees of importance (helping me identify what things I should expend extra energy to finish if they're not complete at the milestone, and what tasks might end up being out of the project's scope—a real help with a project that has so many possible features!); and</li>
	<li><strong>breaking work into sprint-like microtasks</strong> by assessing the difficulty of each task, estimating the time it will take to complete (and then often multiplying that by two), and making sure each task fits into at most four hours of work (if something sounds like it will take longer than four hours, it needs to be broken into smaller tasks).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">This process helps me have a sense of what <em>needs</em> to be complete by the end of the month for the project to move on, and what things would only be nice to have finished by that time (and if they're not, they get dropped, not pushed into next month's task list and making it even bigger and less manageable). I'm sure there are other great ways to organize your dissertation tech work (true agile development, for example)—but these three steps help me regularly reassess my work as well as regularly reward myself for my work through free time: if I finish all my assigned tasks in a week, I stop working on the dissertation and do something else until the next week starts (well, that only happens sometimes—I'm also a fan of frontloading a month's work and then taking a bigger chunk of time off at the end of each month, but I only do that when I'm really enjoying the work and don't need the break).</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Don't plan ahead too minutely: take your work a month at a time
</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">You can create major monthly milestones for your entire project by setting a few very top-level goals, but don't spend time elaborating on the sub-tasks of later milestones; these will have changed by several months into your project and aren't worth spending time on right now.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While finalizing my prospectus, I did lay out a month-by-month schedule of tasks to make sure everything seemed to fit: could I time a beta release of my site to coincide with my MLA presentation/demo? was there enough time at the end of each project to not only conduct user testing, but do further code and design work in response to the tests' results? I was able to arrange the three projects so that I could spend one year on the first one (Infinite Ulysses, both the most ambitious project and the project that should be most polished by my defense), with half a year on each of the other projects allowing me to create prototypes, but not necessarily stand-alone unbreakable final products. After that initial check as to the reasonableness of my ambitions, I've focused my planning time just on that first project. At the start of each month, I plan what I want to have completed by the end of the month, adjust the monthly task list accordingly, and label my tasks by difficulty and priority. (Using <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/taskpaper" target="_blank">TaskPaper</a> for my private dissertation timeline is great because I can tag tasks in a variety of ways and pull them up accordingly. Just enough time for an easy task? Command-F "@easy".)</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Public versus private timelines</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">I haven't announced a public timeline for release of my work yet, and don't plan to until I can see the end of the tunnel in terms of pushing the Infinite Ulysses site live. Digital work forces additional variables into the already mutable timeline of dissertating: I want to advance my technical skills with this research, so I'll be doing some things code-wise that I haven't done before and don't know how long they'll take; the time it takes to recruit site testers, run user testing, and respond to the results is unclear; and I might have so much more I want to do by the end of this first project that I decide extend it into the second year of my dissertation. One of the <a title="Digital Projects from Start to Finish: DH Mentorship from One Week One Tool (OWOT)" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/owotdayone1">nuggets of tech-planning wisdom</a> Patrick Murray-John gave the <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/www.oneweekonetool.org" target="_blank">One Week | One Tool</a> team was to give the public some indication of your plans for a project, but make that timeline much more high-level than the internal schedule by which the work actually gets done. Once the Infinite Ulysses site goes live, I'll post my plans in terms of taking feedback and adding requested features, but before then I'm reserving the right to take as much time as is needed to do a fantastic job. (Release hint, though: it'd be awful nice to have a beta site live when I present on the Infinite Ulysses project at MLA 2014...)</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Keep your mentors in the loop</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">I've shared a GoogleDoc containing my monthly timeline (created while polishing the dissertation prospectus ((A prospectus is a dissertator's written plan and rationale for her dissertation, submitted to both committee and department at the start of her work: both a roadmap and a promise))) with my advisors. While I was was out of state over the summer, it was a way to give them a sense of what I'm doing in a given month, since instead of the traditional "writing/editing a chapter" I might be messing with a local server, writing new code, designing a site, writing and running user tests, blogging... and since I leave tasks on the timeline but strike them out when they've been completed, it's a nice way for me to look back and see what I was doing at a given point (and feel a little proud for everything I've already done towards the dissertation). The shared timeline also gives me just enough of an accountability reminder that I think very hard about putting off tasks assigned for the given month.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Have other techniques for staying sane and satisfied with your dissertation? Have a list of non-monograph humanities dissertation deliverables to share? Let me know in the comments or <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Literature_Geek" target="_blank">@Literature_Geek</a>!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I took my candidacy exams for the Ph.D. in English at the end of September. The exam itself was fun and immensely validating (especially as someone coming to the Ph.D. with a non-literature master’s degree), and <strong>the experience of preparing for the exam is one of the great overlooked reasons for getting a doctorate</strong>. <!--more-->You'll never have this much time to devote just to reading, reading, reading—or if you do (well-funded sabbatical?), sticking to a reading schedule and forcing yourself to develop extensive declarative knowledge to this extent require a truly iron resolve and a high-stakes final platform for proving yourself. ((Okay, that sounds an awful lot like writing a book or any other major research project. But rarely will you be this free from other obligations and this strong an impetus to succeed—I’m holding by the idea that preparing for the candidacy exam is a special time.)) Managing exams is a great way to figure out how you do your best research—a trial run for the dissertation. And even the stress of exams is good: it will force you to make declarative and nuanced ideas you’ve been flirting with for years.

<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ExamsSharingCopy.pdf">Here's my reading list (covering works on and from the digital humanities and textual scholarship) and rationale for what's on the list</a>. And here's a list of everything that helped me before and during my exam:

[caption id="attachment_1135" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/indexstack.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1135" title="indexstack" alt="Pile of index cards used in studying for my exams" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/indexstack-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a> The epic stack of index cards I used to force my knowledge to be declarative.[/caption]
<ol id="internal-source-marker_0.4158615695098503">
	<li dir="ltr">Each department differs, so <strong>know what exam format to prepare for early in the exams reading process</strong>. What is the required length of the presentation (if any)? Can you bring slides and brief notes? Ask a fellow student or your advisor to give you a few mock exams questions early in your readings so you know how you should be reading.</li>
	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Ask your committee to sign off on your reading list early in the process so that you can create and hold to a reading schedule</strong>. I knew I would have a week before the exam to develop a presentation on a question prepared by my committee, so I made sure my reading was done before that week.</li>
	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Try to schedule time after your reading is finished to process everything.</strong> I used two weeks to brainstorm a list of every question I felt I should be able to answer eloquently: drafted them on a whiteboard, then put them on index cards that I could flip through whenever I had a few spare minutes. In retrospect, this overprepared me for the exam, but I'd do it again—it prepared me just the right amount for what comes after the exam (you can't know too much about your area of study, right? or about the types of questions you should be asking and have an opinion on?).</li>
	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Figure out where and how you’ll get your reading done.</strong> Earplugs plus getting on the campus bus going the wrong way from work gave me a solid fifty minutes, twice a day, in which I couldn’t do anything but read or go through my stack of index cards.</li>
	<li dir="ltr">While you're anticipating questions, <strong>start thinking about where you want to take the experience.</strong> What are the major questions you want to talk about, and how will you steer conversation that way? How will the backgrounds of your committee members direct those discussions? You can probably start to outline points your presentation will cover even before you get your presentation question.</li>
	<li dir="ltr">Take paper notes during reading if that's useful to you, but <strong>schedule yourself to digitize these regularly</strong> (don't let them pile up...). Most of your readings will influence your dissertation, and you'll thank yourself when you're able to do a keyword search for some great phrase you half recall—or export a citation list quickly—instead of hunting through a stack of papers.</li>
	<li dir="ltr">Don't just digitize your notes: <strong>put them into citation management software as you create them</strong>. I use<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/www.zotero.org"> Zotero</a>, which is free and syncs to Zotero's servers; there's the option to share your citations (and also your notes on these) if you're willing, but you can also keep things private. If you use the Zotero browser plugin, you can take snapshots of articles you're viewing online and link these to your citation.</li>
	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Know your exams room</strong>. Will you have a podium to stand behind? Do you have the correct dongle to connect your computer to the projector? Also think about the layout of the room and what makes you comfortable, since you'll have time to rearrange tables and chairs before your committee arrives—choose whether a more formal or conversational layout makes you most comfortable.</li>
	<li dir="ltr">If you're like most people and have some public speaking anxiety, <strong>know how you're going to deal with that stress.</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">Don’t think about the exam as a quiz or trial—you’re being asked to talk about what you know and how various issues relate to things you care about. You can practice a standard answer format if that helps you out (your answer, three examples from the reading list that connect/critique/juxtapose, and address possible quibbles with your argument), but you probably won’t consciously rely on this structure—your exam should (one hopes) turn more into a conversation than a test. <strong>You could think of exams as a way of making well-structured responses automatic. </strong></li>
	<li dir="ltr">Starting off with a well-practiced presentation will help you feel in control and relaxed enough to enjoy the rest of the experience.</li>
	<li dir="ltr">You should know your research areas well by now, and everyone in the room is just looking for ways to let you show that expertise. You’ll rarely get this many smart people in a room to spend hours talking about your interests, so enjoy it!</li>
	<li dir="ltr">One more practical thing: plan on getting to campus early—you don't want to worry about traffic or missing the bus the day of your exam.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
10. <strong>Things to bring to your exam</strong>:
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">a paper copy of your exams reading list for consultation during Q&amp;A</li>
	<li dir="ltr">a watch (to know how much time you have)</li>
	<li dir="ltr">a flash drive with copy of presentation slides and notes (my laptop experienced surprise death 48 hours after my presentation; be prepared to use someone else's computer)</li>
	<li dir="ltr">a water cup (not bottle, which is more difficult to drink from when standing)</li>
	<li dir="ltr">a couple pens and <strong>a lot of blank paper</strong> (ideally, a spiral; I used about ten sheets during the Q&amp;A to jot down bullet points for my response as the questions were being asked)</li>
	<li dir="ltr">the location of the room where you'll be presenting</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
Good luck and have fun!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Thinking Through Making: More Precedents for Scholarly Experimentation as Critical Work</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">I've <a title="Experimental Editions: Digital Editions as Methodological Prototypes" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/experimental-editions">written previously</a> about how experiments and new methods with textual editions and tools function as scholarly arguments; in this post I'll give a few more examples of how experimental humanities building beyond digital editions can act as critical argument. I'll also discuss precedents for dissertational making as scholarship that doesn't require duplication in monograph form. Hoping these provide a starting place for others building an argument for starting similarly practice-focused dissertations!</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Speculative computing and timely experiments</h3>
<p dir="ltr">“Speculative computing” is a flavor of digital humanities that emphasizes the subjective, the aesthetic, and the non-computational in humanities computing work. While on the one hand relying on an experimental or provocational approach somewhat unfamiliar to the traditional humanist, speculative computing is a response to what humanists saw as the loss of subjectivity and aesthetics experienced by the humanities as it came into contact with the algorithms, code, and objectivity of computer science ((Drucker, Johanna. <em>Speclab: Digital Aesthetics and Projects in Speculative Computing</em>. University of Chicago Press, 2009.)) ((Burdick, Anne, et al. <em>Digital_Humanities</em>. MIT Press, 2012.)). A similar approach, speculative design, imagines future challenges and opportunities—as with my designing a digital edition that could handle a hypothetical public wildly interested in annotating a complex text—and builds design solutions both imbued with theoretical innovation and the possibility of future utility ((Lukens, Jonathan and Carl DiSalvo. “Speculative Design and Technological Fluency”.<em> IJLM</em> 3.4 (2012). 23-40.)).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Less speculative, more immediately applicable experimental work is routinely pursued by major digital humanities centers such as my workplace, the <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mith.umd.edu" target="_blank">Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities</a>. As DH centers moved from sites of service to sites of inquiry over the past twenty years, so too has humanities work shifted to include digital projects not just as means to literary understanding, but as embodying literary arguments themselves. In addition to the larger projects pursued by DH centers, smaller interventions by individuals and student groups are also common in the digital humanities; Jean Bauer’s <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/davila.html" target="_blank">DAVILA</a> is a digital overlay for DH project databases that reveals the critical choices inherent in relational database structure to non-developers, and the Praxis Program’s <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/prism.scholarslab.org" target="_blank">Prism</a> visualizes the intersection of many interpretations of a common text.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Precedents for dissertational making as scholarship</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">While dissertations focused on experiments (such as medical studies or the creation of a programming language aimed at a specific computing problem) are fairly normal in non-humanities fields, a dissertation that centers itself on building as much as mine does—building that does not also require a complete doubling of work effort in the form of an accompanying book-length dissertation—is still rare within the humanities (although monographs plus digital building work has become fairly normal). This is not at all to say that such work is without precedent, of course—coding as scholarly work is largely an accepted method within the field of digital humanities. It's digital building within the strictures of the dissertation that has yet to acquire methodological normalcy, for reasons ranging from the values of the granting body (most humanities PhDs are in non-digitally centered programs such as literature and history, rather than digital humanities departments), to the problems of evaluating non-monograph writing, to the all-too-often real need to conceive one's dissertation as a stepping stone towards a tenure-track teaching job (with the risk of embarking on work that colleagues might not recognize as valid, or not know how to evaluate).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even in the most traditional literature departments, though, there is a precedent for thesis work focused on producing a scholarly object instead of only a written piece; a dissertation focused on producing a scholarly edition of a literary text has long been accepted as a valid final product (I imagine the same is true in other humanities fields such as history). To illustrate the trend toward dissertations deeply intertwined with their digital components, consider a current and a former member of my department (the <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/english.umd.edu" target="_blank">English Department</a> at the University of Maryland): my advisor Matthew Kirschenbaum’s 1999 <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/title.html" target="_blank">digital dissertation</a> was the first at the University of Virginia and one of the first in the country, and UMD alumna Tanya Clement’s 2009 <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/9160" target="_blank">dissertation</a> made strong use of digital editing and modeling tools. My diverse background in information science, web design/development, and user studies helps me pursue what is, for a humanities dissertation, a non-traditional but effective and historically inevitable method of inquiry. In my next post, I'll discuss the current conversation around non-traditional (i.e. non-monograph) forms of scholarly production: do all digital scholarly objects require a written narrative, or do some projects incorporate analysis without a side serving of text?</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/2013/12/editors-choice-copyleft-ip-rights-and-digital-humanities-dissertations/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3186" alt="Logo for DHNow Editors' Choice Post" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DHnowEditor.jpg" width="100" height="100" /></a>Who holds the intellectual property (IP) rights to your digital dissertation? In my case, the answer is complicated, involving multiple licenses and stakeholders.

Digital humanities productions brings new licensing concerns to the humanities. Our pre-digital discussions around IP usually centered around book contracts and open-access journals; rights claims from any agency that funds you during the production of a scholarly work might affect where you can publish or what types of acknowledgement you must include, but I'm assuming such agreements rarely control the reuse or extension of that work the way licensing for code, design, and digital content does. Digital humanities dissertations are an interesting case, given that they are usually "authored" by one person (although they may benefit from just as much collaborative support from librarians, faculty, and other academic mentors as any other scholarly endeavor), not completed while on the clock for a job, and may be supported funding from multiple sources, with a variety of IP stakes in your work.

[pullquote]Being clear on the IP status of the different pieces of your digital dissertation is good practice, even if it's only an exercise to help you think about licensing future, larger projects.[/pullquote]For my dissertational <a title="Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/infinite-ulysses-intro/">Infinite Ulysses</a> project, I'm building off open-source code from a variety of sources: the community of Drupal developers, a tech non-profit, and a grant-funded initiative (<a href="http://editingmodernism.ca" target="_blank">Editing Modernism in Canada</a>) that is also providing a fellowship supporting a year of my dissertational work. In drafting an IP agreement for this project, I needed to think both about the rights I want to assert for the code (Drupal modules), design (Drupal themes), and content (written annotations, tutorials, etc. appearing on my sites) I create, <em>and</em> my continued access to code created by others (e.g. after the end of the fellowship, would I have access to updated versions of code from my funder?).

I'd like to think that good faith keeps DH informational exchanges smooth and that IP agreements—especially for projects like dissertations—will never need to act as real shields. On the other hand, digital projects have an unfortunate history of not being correctly attributed; digital archives are consulted but not cited, or a digital object is used but the (unused) print version is cited. Good working relationships with funders or departments aren't a shield against pressure for commercial gains from higher up in a university or organization, or different ideas about intellectual property when an organization shifts into new hands. Being clear on the IP status of the different pieces of your digital dissertation is good practice, even if it's only an exercise to help you think about licensing future, larger projects.
<h2>My Experience</h2>
Off the top of my head, I can think of twelve forms of information I'm dealing with in the <a title="Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/infinite-ulysses-intro/">Infinite Ulysses</a> project, with varied IP licensing:
<h3>Information I'm creating:</h3>
1. Posts about the project appearing on my personal research blog (<a title="Home" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/">LiteratureGeek.com;</a> the site is marked "CC BY-NC unless otherwise specified")

2. Content blogged or cross-posted to the <a href="http://editingmodernism.ca/community/" target="_blank">EMiC blog</a> (unclear)

3. Contextual annotations, questions, and answers affixed to the text of Ulysses, created by me (almost definitely some flavor of Creative Commons license)

4. Infinite Ulysses site content (e.g. tutorials, about page text, etc.; possibly rights reserved, possibly CC0 if I want to go the whole way with the idea that anyone should be able to completely replicate my work)

5. Marketing/outreach materials (e.g. tweets, stickers, videos; some flavor of Creative Commons license )
<h3><strong>Information created by others:</strong></h3>
6. The <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/~mvp1922/portfolio/ulysses-shakespeare-co-1922-1st-edn/" target="_blank">CC-licensed MVP Ulysses text</a> (digitized by Matthew Kochis and Patrick Belk of the University of Tulsa; CC BY-NC-SA 3.0; production funded by one or more grants)

7. The open-source <a href="https://drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a> CMS (The trademark "Drupal" belongs to Dries Buytaert, but the Drupal Association has the ability to use the trademark freely as long as it meets certain requirements. The Drupal files and all contributed files hosted on Drupal.org, such as modules and themes, are licensed under the GNU General Public License. Drupal offers an <a href="https://drupal.org/licensing/faq" target="_blank">extensive licensing FAQ</a>.)

8. Various used-as-is Drupal modules, and Drupal modules created by other developers and then modified/extended by me (GPL)

9. Code gathered from <a href="https://github.com/Islandora" target="_blank">Islandora repos</a> (GPL)

10. Code gathered from <a href="https://github.com/DGI-EMiC" target="_blank">DGI-EMiC repos</a> (GPL or unclear)

11. Contextual annotations, questions, answers, profile information, and any other content an Infinite Ulysses site visitor or account-holder might input to the site (site use agrees to a CC license, possibly CC0; there may be an option to keep a site account-holder's inputs private from the public but not from me, limiting the possibility of bad-faith commercial reuse)

12. Input from user-testing surveys (users agree to CC0 on anonymized answers)

As with any scholarly project, I'm building on the work of others and putting my work out for reuse—leading to many types of information and information licensing.

I've been thinking seriously about using CC0 whenever it's a possibility, because of the chilling effect on reuse and remixing caused by a potential user needing to navigate unfamiliar or varied licensing demands. CC0 is the Creative Commons license that releases information into the public domain <em>without</em> limiting requirements such as attribution to the creator (BY), sharing any remixed/reused information under the same license as the original (share alike, or SA), or prohibiting commercial reuse (NC). Some form of CC or other free-reuse-allowing license is necessary if I actually want for someone to hypothetically duplicate my work.
<h2>The University and IP Rights</h2>
Your university almost definitely has a policy on the licensing of intellectual property created by students and staff, so you'll want to check it out early in your project and be certain that your rights are what you think they are; preferably, get a written acknowledgment from your university's IP office or lawyer that you can file in case questions arise later on. My <a href="http://www.president.umd.edu/policies/docs/IV-320A.pdf" target="_blank">university's IP policy</a> is a bit unclear in my particular situation; generally, students retain rights over code created during a dissertation, but there is a clause suggesting that a student having a "written agreement" related to the dissertation with some other party might negate those rights. Does applying for and receiving an academic fellowship that partially supports a year of the dissertation count as a "written agreement"? I decided to check now instead of having trouble later, but after six weeks of emails (including several times reminding the tech IP office that they hadn't given me a response), I sent a final email identifying a deadline I'd need to hear from them by, or I'd consider my rights retained. That deadline passed with no word from the IP office. I'm really not expecting there to be any issues; it's not like the site will be generating money or I'll be creating something that someone else will use to make money, but it's still nice to have that chain of emails for the record.
<h2>Creative Commons? CC Zero?</h2>
Creative Commons (CC) licenses are not appropriate for executed code; they weren't developed with software in mind and don't mention executable code in their language (CC actually <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Can_I_apply_a_Creative_Commons_license_to_software.3F" target="_blank">recommends against</a> using its licenses for software). <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Data#Can_databases_be_released_under_CC_licenses.3F" target="_blank">CC licenses <em>can</em> be used on databases</a>, but you should <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Data#When_a_CC_license_is_applied_to_a_database.2C_what_is_being_licensed.3F" target="_blank">read about exactly what of a database is being protected</a>.

For information that can be appropriately licensed by CC, digital humanists <a href="http://nowviskie.org/2011/why-oh-why-cc-by/" target="_blank">Bethany Nowviskie</a> and <a href="http://www.dancohen.org/2013/11/26/cc0-by/" target="_blank">Dan Cohen</a> have both written convincing arguments for licensing your work using CC0, aka CC Zero ((CC0 is the Creative Commons license that releases information into the public domain without limiting requirements such as attribution to the creator (BY), sharing any remixed/reused information under the same license as the original (share alike, or SA), or prohibiting commercial reuse (NC) )). Their arguments include:
<ul>
	<li>in the humanities, there isn't a huge risk of our work being reused for nefarious commercial profit (although the rise of MOOCs may change that); the real risk is of never being read/used, so make it easy for your work to be remixed, extended, and spread</li>
	<li>people who would reuse your work in bad faith will probably do so regardless of your licensing choice</li>
	<li>forcing the potential reuser/remixer/extender to deal with a bewildering array of different licenses has a chilling effect on beneficial reuse or extension of your work</li>
</ul>
Dan Cohen advocates for using CC0 while also providing guidance in terms of best practices for your information's use (e.g. attribution isn't required by law, but it's a nice and useful thing to do). The <a href="http://dp.la" target="_blank">Digital Public Library of America</a> (DPLA) offers <a href="http://dp.la/info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DPLADataUseBestPractices.pdf" target="_blank">a good example of an information best practices statement</a>; you might use the DPLA's to model a similar (possibly shorter, given the size of your project) set of guidelines for use of your information. For my Infinite Ulysses site, I'll probably write a page showing how to attribute each type of the site's content and suggesting some ways of reusing and extending my work.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Digital humanist <a href="https://twitter.com/scott_bot" target="_blank">Scott Weingart</a>'s website includes <a href="http://www.scottbot.net/HIAL/?page_id=3086" target="_blank">a "pledges" page</a> that records his definition of being a good scholarly citizen: committing to open access and open source all the time, reducing barriers to participation in and extension of his scholarly work. This is an awesome idea: publicly recording what's important to you helps regularly check that you're acting in a way that accords with your values, and not just when it's convenient ((If more scholars did this, we could look at word and topic frequencies and compare individuals' values to what we perceive as the values of the DH community as a whole)). For example, if accessibility is important to me, I need to make certain that value is reflected in my current work, and I need to educate or reject participation in venues (conferences, projects) that don't care about accessibility.

[pullquote]I need to actively check that what I build not only reflects the values I blog about, but non-verbally demonstrates them.[/pullquote]I spend most of my scholarly time at present on dissertational work—web development, design, and blogging—so I want to record my values in relation to these activities. These values come across clearly in my dissertational blogging, with statements
<ul>
	<li>On a public, participatory humanities: "I intend to build tools and digital editions that help everyone—textual scholars and the lay person—participate in our love for the nuances of a text’s materiality, history, and meaning... a more public textual studies—a textual studies that encourages participation outside of a limited circle of expertise" (<a title="Building for the Great Conversation: Participatory Digital Design &amp; the Urgency of the Public Humanities" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/dhdisspublichumanities/" target="_blank">here</a>)</li>
	<li>On reifying and testing our theories about digital objects: "We need to build these [textual] theories into our digital editions such that their innovative arguments are... empirically testable via user studies" (<a title="Building for the Great Conversation: Participatory Digital Design &amp; the Urgency of the Public Humanities" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/dhdisspublichumanities/" target="_blank">here</a>)</li>
	<li>On allowing your work to be extended and reused: "I’ll be releasing this project’s code (Drupal modules, themes) on GitHub so that anyone can reuse or modify my work in their own digital edition." (<a title="Infinite Ulysses: Project Precedents and Caveats" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/infinite-ulysses-background/" target="_blank">here</a>)</li>
</ul>
As I'm building my dissertation projects to assess textual theories, <strong>I need to actively check that what I build not only reflects the values I blog about, but non-verbally demonstrates them</strong>. Below, I've listed these various values in one place and tried to identify where in my dissertational projects they will be reified ((I'm sure I'll forget something important to me that has become a tacit part of how I work—looking forward to that inevitable discovery after posting this!)):
<h2>Values</h2>
<strong>1. Accessibility = universal design.</strong> As much as possible, design for all readers; build on existing work on usability and accessibility to create better DH-specific accessibility tutorials and standards. Library website accessibility and usability work is a fruitful place for research, as the structure and use of library websites is similar to that of a complex digital scholarly edition.

<strong>2. A public humanities</strong>. Teaching is knowing; you should be able to explain your work to a non-specialist audience (without forgetting there's no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Road#A_metaphorical_.E2.80.9CRoyal_Road.E2.80.9D_in_famous_quotations" target="_blank">royal road</a> to geometry, of course! (("It is too bad that [the language for explaining mathematics] has to be mathematics, and that mathematics is hard for some people. It is reputed - I do not know if it is true - that when one of the kings was trying to learn geometry from Euclid he complained that it was difficult. And Euclid said, "There is no royal road to geometry". And there is no royal road. Physicists cannot make a conversion to any other language. If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in." —Richard Feynman)) ). While using speculative experiments is a key methodology for at least the <em>Infinite Ulysses</em> portion of my dissertation (what happens if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?), I also want these experiments to produce deliverables useful here and now (a participatory edition for reading and discussing <em>Ulysses</em>).

<strong>3. A public humanities is a participatory humanities.</strong> Our work is to preserve human culture, and preservation = propagation (see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ready-Player-One-A-Novel/dp/0307887448" target="_blank"><em>Ready Player One</em></a>). Communication of our nerdy passions should be a two-way conversation, with the new questions and thoughts from readers outside our field or the academy brought into the great conversation. User-testing incorporates audience participation into the design as well as the final use of a project, but the digital humanities has been slow to establish best practices for <a title="DH Evaluation: A Four-Part Series on User Testing Your DH Work" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/3partdheval/" target="_blank">DH-specific user-testing</a>. I hope to help make user-testing easier to include in a grant timeline by exploring and consolidating best practices.

<strong>4. Scholarly design and development.</strong> Interface is argument: a critical act both to create and read. Building is scholarship, and while I don't believe that many works of built scholarship require replication in text to stand as intellectual contributions to the community, some sort of narrative of the methods and experience of creating the work is important to its reception and usage, and to reach a wider, non-technical community, that often means a written narrative. The benefits of reaching a wider audience by replicating your built scholarly work in an article or monograph aren't as important as getting that work done, though—so we need to advocate for student projects and dissertations to be accepted in forms other than the monograph, because the common requirement of doubling one's built scholarship with a monograph spreads a chilling effect on young scholars' interest in trying design, coding, and other digital or non-monograph-form scholarly work.

<strong>5. Design is not pre-critical.</strong> When I consider an edition and what information it's trying to express, I've moved from thinking about the narrative content of a piece of literature to aspects such as its interpretations and reception history—those features the scholarly editor foregrounds in their textual notes and methodology, aspects which a well-designed interface can support or augment. This information-centered approach requires thinking about your audience and your goals for the use of your scholarly product. What we see when we encounter an edition shapes the questions we raise, the biases we inherit, and the things we end up knowing; as <a href="http://journals.tdl.org/paj/index.php/paj/article/view/8" target="_blank">Jon Saklofske asks</a> during his reimagining of the Blake Archive interface: what are the interpretive resonances of redesign? ((Saklofske, Jon. "NewRadial: Revisualizing the Blake Archive". <i>Poetess Archive Journal</i> 2.1 (December 2010).))

<strong>6. Accurate semantics for situating what we do.</strong> Be as sensitive to how I construct non-digital or non-making scholarly work as I am to how scholarly building is often treated (e.g. "developers aren't scholars, or at least not when they're coding/designing"). I want to be wary of characterizing anything as "traditional work" or "non-digital"; these terms are too wide and abstract, carry connotations of datedness, and, most importantly—digital work IS traditional in the sense of following a tradition of practice (as with creating and designing editions in textual theory, or as with algorithmic criticism pre-computer, as Steve Ramsay shows in <a href="http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/75tms2pw9780252036415.html" target="_blank"><em>Reading Machines</em></a>). Building and design experiments have a long history as part of the textual scholar's intellectual toolkit; it isn’t whether something is written, or can be described linguistically, that determines whether critical thought went into it and scholarly utility comes out of it: it’s the appropriateness of the form to the argument, and the availability of that argument to discussion and evaluation in the scholarly community.

<strong>7. Documentation.</strong> Part of accessibility and participatory design is making your technical and design decisions/methodology understandable to people not versed in the skills you employed. Good documentation can be a fairly simple by-product of good technical practice; for example, I basically produced a guide to creating your own Islandora digital edition site just by recording all my attempts, failures, and successes as I set up my own site (with the additional benefit that I could remember what I had already tried and places I might need to go back and alter).

<strong>8. Open source, open access: clone my work and read it too.</strong> Here's a simpler way of putting it: your documentation should be so good that someone willing to put in the time and technical learning could hypothetically replicate your exact work completely (e.g. I'm hoping to make it clear how to "make your own Infinite Ulysses site") and more probably, create their own intellectual argument using the tools and scholarly form you documented. All code should be distributed with some license allowing at least free, non-commercial reuse (and although Creative Commons licenses aren't appropriate for code meant to be run, <a href="http://nowviskie.org/2011/why-oh-why-cc-by/" target="_blank">Bethany Nowviskie's argument</a> for not keeping a non-commercial requirement on your work is pretty convincing). As a corollary to making my code reusable and understandable, when I do get around to publishing about my dissertation via journal articles or other peer-reviewed platforms, it's important that I retain rights to the content allowing me to make it freely available to anyone to access.<strong>
</strong>
<h2>Values Reified</h2>
I should also write a set of blog posts exploring how each value ends up functioning as part of my dissertation and what difficulties (if any) impeded the value's inclusion (I'll come back and link each of the listed values to the posts as they are written).

Have you written something explaining your scholarly values? Add it to <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/digital_humanities/items/collectionKey/JFJE65BA" target="_blank">the "Values" folder in the Digital Humanities Zotero library</a> and we can look at word and topic frequencies in digital humanist values!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm starting to flesh out the <a title="Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2013/06/24/infinite-ulysses-intro/">Infinite Ulysses</a> site's content: pages explaining my methodology, how to use the site, etc. Eventually, I'll be thinking about how I want people to progress through the site (by creating and walking through the site in several example user personas ((As a Latinist, this spelling makes me uncomfortable, but I believe it makes sense from common usability usage. Also: did you know that "persona" in classical Latin means "mask"?)) ) and how they'll probably actually use the site (arrive and want to jump right in to reading the text and using the features).

For the latter (most likely) case, I'll probably offer a short (60 seconds or less) video tutorial on setting up an account and using all the features of the site, as well as an option that walks you through one way of using the site (probably something like <a href="http://buildinginspector.nypl.org/building" target="_blank">how NYPL Labs introduces users to their Building Inspector site</a>). I'll need to figure out how to balance people who want to jump right into site use via intuitive design of the various features, and encouraging site visitors to take five minutes and learn the site's full capabilities before using it. Those visitors who actually end up reading some or all of <em>Ulysses</em> on the site will be spending a lot of time on it, so it's worth their while to know all the features available to them—but it will be my job to convince them of that (and make the features worthy of their use).
<h2><strong>Usability Testing and Site Visitor Personas</strong></h2>
I'm not at the point of testing the site via personas yet, but I've started to record feedback from various people I've talked with about my projects with an eye toward the personas' eventual creation. A <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html" target="_blank">usability persona</a> is a representation of a potential user group for your website, based on real feedback and condensed into a single representative fictional character against which you can test the site experience. I've given my initial personas silly names to help me quickly step through these four approaches to site use whenever I'm considering a new feature:
<ul id="docs-internal-guid-62083738-cad2-c155-8675-fd852dff0faa">
	<li dir="ltr">Riley Read-Everything (a user who wants to go through all the background info on the site before committing to reading, who needs a clear architecture for reading through the various non-<em>Ulysses</em> pages on the site)</li>
	<li dir="ltr">Jessie Jump-Right-In (a first-time reader of <em>Ulysses </em>who jumps right into reading and annotating and asking questions, requiring intuitively designed site functionality)</li>
	<li dir="ltr">Taylor the Teacher (a user orchestrating group work on <em>Ulysses</em>, possibly with private annotations or other teaching/book club requirements)</li>
	<li dir="ltr">Sam the Scholar (a user with some <em>Ulysses </em>experience who wants to help out by adding contextual annotations and answering questions, perhaps by adding a bulk list of their existing annotations; and/or wants to understand and engage in scholarly uses of the site such as curating a themed/argument-making set of annotations)</li>
</ul>
The persona walkthroughs will be followed by real site use and usability testing, first with a small group of friends and colleagues (which will help me create an updated set of usability personas), then with a limited beta testing group, and finally with the site open to everyone.
<h2>Potential Site Content</h2>
A developing list of content for informational pages I'll probably want to publish on the Infinite Ulysses site:
<ul>
	<li>Inspired by <a href="http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/#inclusivity" target="_blank">the Speaking in Code inclusivity statement</a>, a statement of welcome encouraging participation by everyone, with a contact form for suggestions on how the site can better its users. This page will also address the positive rights of the site users, such as the site being a safe space to ask questions (however simple) and to provide answers from any viewpoint, and a clear path for reporting any issues within the site user community.</li>
	<li>User profile pages (for finding active readers on the site who have similar interests or backgrounds, for recording demographics on the site user base, etc.)</li>
	<li>An explanation of copyrights and other licensing active on the site (what rights do users maintain over content shared with the site? what licenses have I applied to my written content, code, and design?)</li>
	<li>Background material on Joyce and the writing of Ulysses (e.g. Ulysses' legal history, versions of the work from drafts onward)</li>
	<li>Development blog (with a timeline, of site work new features, bugs fixed, questions for existing users)</li>
	<li>A support forum (intended for questions about site usage and bug reporting; postings that are questions about the text may be lifted to the textual annotations)</li>
	<li>An explanation of the core set of tags I'm providing when the site opens for public use (what they mean, who they may be useful to, why I included them, how to add your own)</li>
	<li>Future plans for the site, with a poll on possible future features of the site</li>
	<li>Contact page</li>
	<li>Unanswered queue: questions about the text that haven't received an answer are pulled onto this page so that it's easier for me and other site users to help one another out in their interpretations</li>
	<li>A page describing the accessibility/universal design work done on the site, future plans for greater accessibility, and a form for suggesting other tactics</li>
	<li>How to use the mobile version of the site</li>
	<li>How to use the site in the classroom to teach <em>Ulysses </em>(how to let students privately annotate the text and have that work only visible to their teacher; how to let students curate their own themed digital edition version of the text)</li>
	<li>How to use the site in reading groups (e.g. book clubs)</li>
	<li>How to add annotations to the site in bulk (i.e. if you have a list or file of Ulysses annotations for some reason and wish to add them to the text without typing them in one by one)</li>
	<li>An explanation of annotation moderation policy (e.g. I reserve the right to unpublish or delete content that is spam, defamatory, or otherwise not supportive of the goals of the project. Whenever the possibility of the content being added to the site in good faith is present, I will contact the author of the content upon unpublishing and either give them a few days to copy their content from the site before I delete it, or send them a copy of the content.)</li>
	<li>Information on my digital humanities and Joyce studies backgrounds, as well as my interests and biases as they effect interpretation of <em>Ulysses</em> and design of digital editions</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Speculative Experiment, Useful Here and Now?: Tagging the Digital Edition</title>

I've been using a site policy on tagging to test the differences between my speculative design and the probable reality of my site's use.<strong>
</strong>

My <a title="Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/infinite-ulysses-intro/" target="_blank">Infinite Ulysses</a> participatory digital edition will let readers and scholars add contextual annotations to James Joyce's Ulysses. Those annotations can be tagged with a word or phrase that will help other readers find their particular signal in the potential noise of a (hypothetically) heavily annotated text; possibilities arising from tagging annotations include:
<ul>
	<li>filtering the annotations to only show those on particular areas of interest (e.g. annotations that translate foreign words, or annotations aimed at first-time readers)</li>
	<li>filtering <em>out</em> annotations the reader doesn't want to see (e.g. spoilers about something that only becomes clear later in the book)</li>
	<li>easily creating a curated "edition" of Ulysses aimed at a specific topic (e.g. an edition meant for use by a class focusing on the place of books, letters, newspapers, and other written material in the Modernist novel)</li>
</ul>
[pullquote]How do you conduct a speculative experiment around a digital humanities tool, while also creating something that's useful to readers and scholars right now?[/pullquote]Ulysses' complexity and hypertextuality make it a great candidate for extension through intense annotation, and I've <a title="Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/infinite-ulysses-intro/" target="_blank">written previously</a> about scholarly concerns over what heavy contextual annotation and interpretation would do to the text: two circumstances that make Ulysses perfect for a speculative experiment ((An approach that can learn about an object such as a digital edition by imagining and designing for a hypothetical and/or future circumstance)) in designing a digital edition with thousands of users actively creating content (annotations, questions/answers) on the site, and generally using the features of the site to their limit.

<strong>So: tagged annotations, and a site designed to customize a large amount of noise so that each reader receives the signal he or she requires.</strong> How can I make this tagging actually work—both in my speculative experiment hypothetical of thousands of active site users, and in the more realistic possibility of far less activity?
<h2>Building for Two Extremes of Site Usage</h2>
I see two possible routes for tag creation: restricting users to a limited set of tags I provide myself (perhaps supplemented with user-created tags by specific request), or allowing users to create and apply their own tags that become part of the public pool of available tags (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy" target="_blank">a folksonomy</a>).

<strong>Trust the users to find how tags serve them best: </strong>I start from the premise that allowing users more control over their reading experience provides them with a more customized reading experience, a major goal of the site. I'd prefer to model what I see as appropriate use of tags, and then assume users will employ the feature in a way that benefits their reading and, by extension, that of other users (even if not in the way I expected). From my experiences dealing with spam and observing internet trolling, though, I'll have a plan in place for moderation of tags before they join the public pool, if early use of the site suggests a need for it (and I assume I'll need some sort of anti-spam tactics, although requiring user accounts and IP banning will be of some help in preventing spammers and allowing real users more freedom).
<h3>So Much Annotation Tagging!</h3>
With my <strong>speculative experiment</strong> hat on, allowing users to build an unbridled folksonomy of thousands of tags sounds like problems: too many tags for moderation by one dissertating graduate student, redundant tags with slightly different spellings or phrasings, and an overwhelming list of possible tags for the user to select from are all possible problems. For a site dealing with extreme amounts of user-generated content, good approaches to moderation draw on the user community (e.g. as in asking users to click a "flag as inappropriate/spam" button when spam is encountered).

I admire <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/" target="_blank">StackExchange's approach to moderation</a> ((I'm also thinking about incorporating StackExchange's feed of unanswered questions into the site—a quick way to see parts of the text you might help another person with, and a way to generate "reputation" points toward a user undergoing less moderation and more automatically public content)), which requires site users to build up "reputation" points through successively more broader site privileges. These privileges range from users who have contributed very little to the site being limited to actions such as flagging posts, to those who have performed enough "reputable" actions on the site being allowed moderator-like abilities such as casting deletion votes on negatively voted answers.

Because I don't want users to have any waiting time before jumping into using the site, I'd need to modify StackExchange's approach so that new users have a full range of user abilities from the very start—but whether annotations and answers they create are visible to the public could be dependent on their site activity (time spent on the site, indicating reading) and/or their contributions (one decent annotation = probably not a spammer). I'd also allow users to create opt-in groups of users who can see their annotations regardless of whether they're visible to the general public, allowing users such as literature classes or book clubs to work together with no delay.
<h3>A Reasonable Amount of Annotation Tagging?</h3>
In <strong>reality</strong>, the site won't generate that extreme level of content described by my speculative experiment. Anecdotal evidence from other <a href="http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/" target="_blank">Speaking in Code</a> attendees suggests that site users creating too many tags won't be an issue; the more likely reality (as with any DH project) is that your project doesn't see enough visitors turn into site users, or enough site users actively adding content (such as new tags) to your site.

Less site use than my speculative extreme is good, because I can design a site that draws on StackExchange's and Reddit's communal moderation, while putting into place a policy that relies on content generation being low enough that I can moderate it if needed (with the help of a "flag for moderation" option for users). The site is built around the idea of communal discussion of Ulysses, and I'd much rather need to moderate public content after it's been posted, then place any delay on a user sharing his thoughts with the community. The StackExchange approach, while great for professionals who have a reason to return to the site and build up reputation, doesn't work quite as well for a DH project where any barrier to entry might turn away potential readers.

I'll be gathering statistics ((e.g. "Community Transcription — Thirty-One Months" <a href="http://wardepartmentpapers.org/blog/?p=1442" target="_blank">http://wardepartmentpapers.org/blog/?p=1442</a>)) and noting design decisions on other crowdsourcing projects over the coming month, with an emphasis on crowdsourcing that requires active user decision-making or interpretation. Crowdsourcing that specifically asks for little active attention on the part of the user is a great place to learn about intuitive design, though. <a href="https://twitter.com/POrg" target="_blank">Peter Organisciak</a>'s recent blog post "<a href="http://crowdresearch.org/blog/?p=8320" target="_blank">CrowdCamp Report: Waitsourcing, approaches to low-effort crowdsourcing</a>" prototypes several crowdsourcing instruments that demonstrate useful ways of lowering effort for user participation, suggesting some novel ways of asking users to help with annotation tags (e.g. I could separate tagging into a feed as with the unanswered questions, or place a small widget in the footer of the site that pulls up an untagged annotation and asks for a tag... unclear whether those would be useful or used, but food for thought).

At the end of the <a title="Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/infinite-ulysses-intro/">Infinite Ulysses</a> project, I expect to address each site feature (e.g. annotation tagging) across three contexts:
<ul>
	<li>precedents from other DH projects (e.g. how tagging moderation was addressed, the amount of tagging users actually supplied)</li>
	<li>the statistical realities of my site, observed via user studies (how often was moderation required? how many tags did users actually apply to annotations?)</li>
	<li>what designing the site with a speculative experiment in mind teaches me about the limits of digital editions</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Blended Approach to Tags</h2>
My current thinking is to take a blended approach to tags: seed the Infinite Ulysses site with contextual annotations before opening it for public viewing, and also seed those annotations with tags ((Tags will link to page with a paragraph providing more information about the tag (for user-provided tags, these might need to be created by me?).)) from a small set of broadly useful ideas:
<ul>
	<li>Each foreign language that appears in the text (church Latin, French...)</li>
	<li>Literary references (e.g. Milton, Shakespeare's specific plays)</li>
	<li>Clues (e.g. to the identity of Bloom's correspondent and Macintosh)</li>
	<li>Spoilers (annotations drawing on information you'd only know if you'd already read the book)</li>
	<li>Vocabulary (help with difficult words, the history and contemporary uses of particular phrases or slang)</li>
	<li>Music (making it easy to pull up references to song, lyrics, poetry in the text)</li>
	<li>Simple and advanced plot explanations (can be toggled off for those not interested in this help)</li>
	<li>Reading media (references to books, newsprint, letters)</li>
	<li>Colonialism and usurpation</li>
	<li>Some sort of tagging that indicates the granularity of an annotation, so that annotations appropriate for scholars versed in interpretations of the book reach them, and annotations helpful to a first-time-reader understanding of the book reach those users (suggested by <a href="http://twitter.com/Yellworque" target="_blank">Ronan Crowley</a>)</li>
</ul>
Users will be free to add their own tags, but I'll keep a close eye on site usee during user testing and decide whether those user-created tags will be automatically public, visible only to the user who created them until I moderate them, or start as private but automatically appear publicly once the user has proven understanding of site use with some small level of activity on the site (<a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/" target="_blank">the StackExchange approach</a>). When I begin user-testing, I'll have a chance to ask users what their preference is and see how tagging might actually play out; I'm excited for my users to show me which option is best for them!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Infinite Ulysses: Spring 2014 Tech Update</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As spring warms up and I'm rapidly approaching the halfway point for my dissertation, I realized I've been blogging basically all theory and design, neglecting a discussion of the tech choices I've been making. So: a quick update on the state of the participatory digital edition I've been designing and coding! (I'll blog some more in-depth posts about weekly tech work once summer begins and my full time belongs to the dissertation.)

I received a fellowship from my department to work full-time on the dissertation (starting in June). That full-time work ((Full time, full time full time—as much as I love my job, can you tell I'm excited to devote the entire week for months to my project?)), combined with the good place I'm at with my current tech stack, should result in some significant tasks finished by the end of August; I'll also be able to meet my goal of beginning alpha testing of the site this September. Additionally, I met with my awesomely supportive dissertation committee at the end of April to make sure we were on the same page as to what dissertation deliverables will look like at the time of my defense next spring, and everything seems to be on track (despite switching the core code off which I'm building the site).
<h2><strong>What I've Been Working On</strong></h2>
The last sixth months were devoted to wire-framing, blogging and working through every design challenge I could think of encountering, and reading up on existing work with digital editions and the online communities from which I'm drawing social mechanics (Reddit and StackExchange). I also set up an Islandora site on a VPS (virtual private server; like a web host, except in addition to managing your web files you manage the entire server as well), and spent some time customizing that and working with Modernist Commons' digital edition modules.
<h2>Switch to Building Off Annotator.js</h2>
I've moved from basing my site on Islandora plus Modernist Commons, to working on a straight Drupal 7 website ((I'm keeping a close eye on developments of Drupal 8 so that I can upgrade the site when 8 takes over)); as I mentioned <a title="Notes from an Islandora Installation (aka Islandora Digital Edition Brain Dump)" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2014/04/07/islandorainstallnotes/" target="_blank">in my post summing up what I learned about Islandora set-up</a>, the Modernist Commons platform is very promising, but relies on several technical requirements that cost a lot of effort to use properly/maintain (e.g. a second database for Fedora in addition to the Drupal database ((Fedora in particular was a resource drain in both senses: taking up a lot of memory = paying for more memory on my virtual server.)) ) to support features much needed by the digital editing community, but out of scope or not applicable to my current project (Modernist Commons will be great at supporting collections of editions that want to incorporate versioning, TEI, and RDF). Modernist Commons is a great project that I look forward to watching develop, and I encourage anyone interested in developing that type of scholarly edition to get in touch with their team.

So: I learned some really useful sysadmin-type things, and I'm comfortable with Islandora if I ever need it for a future project. The current tech suite for my project is much better streamlined, only requiring the code needed to run my specific project, making it easier for me to create a generic set of code so that others can easily spin up their own participatory digital edition like mine.

I'm now building off the Javascript Annotator code from the Open Knowledge Foundation; there's already a (limited, slightly buggy, but very useful) implementation of a Drupal module to port this code to Drupal usage and to allow storing annotations in the Drupal database. My goal for this month (May 2014) is to finesse how annotations are stored; they're already accessible in <a href="https://drupal.org/project/views" target="_blank">Views</a>, but tags aren't stored with the annotations (meaning that tags you create on annotations are lost with each page refresh) and existing Drupal modules for upvoting and other social mechanics aren't able to act on the annotations.
<h2>Summer Plans</h2>
Once I address those two issues, I'll be set to spend my summer months (June through August) full-time on site theming, user workflows, and setting up another basic feature of the site: "curated" editions. (I should probably start calling these "custom" editions—I understand how some people have Strong Opinions about the use and misuse of "curation"—but I like the connotation of <em>thoughtful</em> gathering of annotations the word lends to the feature, so I'm being lazy about my diction).

Whatever I end up calling it, the “curation” feature will let users easily toggle on a set of tagged annotations so that custom versions of the edition (just with those tagged annotations) may be shared. For example, a professor could annotate all the appearances of books, letters, and other forms of writing in the text and use this as the basis of a discussion with her students; students could also create their “own” editions singly or in groups, either by presenting an edition with their own collected annotations, or a combination of annotations they’d written and curated from existing annotations on the site.

One nice thing about ironing out storage issues means that I can start inputting my own annotations of <em>Ulysses</em> and not worry about losing that effort; I'll also be able to provide a guarantee to early beta testers of the site that any annotations they create will be retained in the official release of the site (even if that means I need to export and import them after further tech changes).
<h2>Theming</h2>
I spent some time reading the docs and trying out several frameworks, from ones I was familiar with (I've used earlier versions of Zen and Omega before) and hadn't heard of before (Aurora):
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://drupal.org/project/omega" target="_blank">Omega</a> (too tied into using the GUI to customize the theme for me)</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CDUQFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrupal.org%2Fproject%2Faurora&amp;ei=cepvU76eEoOMyATk_YC4Aw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGSyREnOrWXS5af8RFqFmYhPktj5A&amp;sig2=phAkKB2NwT3lRJ2TBTaUFw&amp;bvm=bv.66330100,d.aWw" target="_blank">Aurora</a> (interesting, but not as widely used as Zen and therefore not as well documented)</li>
	<li><a href="https://drupal.org/project/zen" target="_blank">Zen</a> (accessible, good balance in amount of code and GUI-hand-holding between Aurora and Omega, and something I've used before)</li>
</ul>
I'm leaning toward building off Zen, but we'll see how things go as I start to work on mobile theming and figure out how to make the site as universally accessible as possible. In the weeks ahead, I'll be writing about how I'm incorporating usability and accessibility studies from other domains into my digital edition site design.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm an invited speaker at the upcoming <a href="http://cdrh.unl.edu/opportunities/nebraskaforum.php" target="_blank">Nebraska Forum on Digital Humanities 2014</a> (April 10-11, 2014). The annual event brings together several senior scholars as well as several young scholars (Ph.D. A.B.D.s or junior faculty) doing exciting DH work. I'll be live-tweeting <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Literature_Geek" target="_blank">@Literature_Geek</a> during the event and will also post my remarks on this blog (<a title="My Digital Dissertation: Public Humanities, Participatory Design, and Infinite Ulysses" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2014/04/20/my-digital-dissertation-update/" target="_blank">here's a full transcript of the talk</a>). Here's a preview!:
<h1>Talk Abstract:</h1>
<h2>"What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up? Public Humanities, Participatory Design, and Infinite Ulysses"</h2>
My <a title="Infinite Ulysses: Planned Features for a Participatory Edition" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2013/06/25/iufeatures/" target="_blank"><em>Infinite Ulysses</em></a> digital dissertation project pursues a speculative experiment: what if we build an edition and everyone shows up and adds their annotations (interpretations, questions, contextualizations) to the text? Combining an unusually complex text (James Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em>) with an approach imagining thousands of site users and annotations allows for the exploration of questions from overlapping fields:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Textual studies:</strong> How can we create digital archives and editions that are not just public, but invite and assist participation from both trained academics and the lay person in our love for the nuances of a text's materiality, history, and meaning?</li>
	<li><strong>Information science:</strong> How can we borrow successful social mechanics from existing online communities (e.g. upvoting, tagging) to create reading and research experiences that adeptly handle not only issues of contextual annotation quantity but also quality?</li>
	<li><strong>Literary studies:</strong> What happens to complex texts—especially those purposefully authored to be hypertextual, chaotic, and encyclopedic—under heavy and thorough annotation and conversation?</li>
</ul>
My talk will cover her past research on DH interface usability, current critical design considerations, and planned usability work for the site. I will also open a meta-discussion around how the methodologies of my project—blogging, open-source coding, design, documentation, and user testing—form a humanities dissertation.
<h1>My Speaker Bio</h1>
Amanda Visconti is a Ph.D. candidate in the University of Maryland Department of English who has worked in a number of roles at MITH (the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities) since 2009; she also holds an M.S.I. in digital humanities HCI from the University of Michigan School of Information. A digital humanist, professional web developer, and textual scholar, Amanda's research focuses on making the humanities more public and participatory, especially through more usable key forms such as digital editions and archives. Her dissertation explores theories about scholarly digital editions, especially of complex Modernisms and other strange texts, putting written theory into practice by blogging the critical process of designing, coding, and user-testing actual digital editions. She regularly writes about her academic research at <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/">LiteratureGeek.com</a> and is on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/Literature_Geek">@Literature_Geek.</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'll be speaking on a panel on "21st-Century Forms for the Dissertation" on Wednesday, and will have more general thoughts to share on using forms other than the monograph to convey your scholarly argument then. Today, though, I'll describe my plans for one of the pieces of my unusually formatted dissertation: <strong>an "interactive" scholarly article</strong> that will serve as public entrance into my dissertational research (I'll get to what the heck the much-abused word "interactive" means here in a minute!).

This dissertation's focus is a website—the <a title="Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2013/06/24/infinite-ulysses-intro/">Infinite Ulysses</a> participatory digital edition of James Joyce's novel <em>Ulysses</em>—and the critical design, coding, contextual annotation, and user-testing work that will make up that piece of scholarly digital editing ((Note that I've downsized the project from <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/digital-dissertation/" target="_blank">the previous three different coding projects</a> to focus on just this Ulysses piece. The dissertation actually had five different coding projects when I was writing my prospectus for it originally... but then I decided I wanted to graduate! I may still pursue the Rochfort-Smith critical visual design project, but that'll depend on the kind of usability work I need to do on the Ulysses site after initial testing.)). This "interactive" article is already building itself through my regular blogging on this site, but it will be more polished than some of this blogging, and also offer some writing that doesn't make it onto the blog for one reason or other, like a research bibliography and full analysis of my user-testing results. The article will also link out to the other pieces of my dissertational work: the <a title="Infinite Ulysses: What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up?" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2013/06/24/infinite-ulysses-intro/">Infinite Ulysses</a> participatory digital edition, code repositories, this blog, etc.

[pullquote]A virtue of this approach is that I can use space to make an argument more easily than in the confines of an ordinary print page.[/pullquote]From the beginning of the dissertation, the idea was to work with a publishing platform that welcomes new media submissions so that I could publish my code/design work as well as my writing—but I've since decided that a developing form of web design that interests me would also be the perfect format for this article. I've called it "an interactive scholarly article" above, I call it an "HTML5 manifesto" in my head, and the <em>New York Times</em> calls their version of it "interactive storytelling", and I'm sure there's some specific phrase that would better capture the picture that's been developing in my head. What I'm hoping to produce is a HTML5 site that uses the fact that it isn't a printed page of paper to convey my argument.
<h1>What does that look like?</h1>
Let's look at some examples of this admittedly broad form to quickly give you the best sense of what I'm thinking:
<ul>
	<li>The New York Time's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/12/30/year-in-interactive-storytelling/" target="_blank">gallery of "interactive storytelling" pieces</a> from last year</li>
	<li>Two random articles from elsewhere on the web I've had bookmarked as examples: an <a href="http://eephusleague.com/magazine/" target="_blank">article on baseball history</a> and one on <a href="http://editsquarterly.com/" target="_blank">photography/film</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://octoverse.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub's example</a> is more like a scrolling slideshow, but I like the emphasis on graphics and charts</li>
	<li>Pretty sure I've read some e-lit that functions very similarly, too...</li>
</ul>
These all function by scrolling down to reveal more content (rather than using the codex-holdover of multiple pages), and employ features such as typography, layout, and embedded video to unfold their narrative—an approach I've personally enjoyed reading, and that gives me a better mental map of the argument I'm following than a traditional paper does.

Text is chunked into sections that may be related in more than the normal linear fashion, in order to cover the multiple but related preoccupations of my work. A virtue of this approach is that I can use space to make an argument more easily than in the confines of an ordinary print page. For example, to discuss the speculative experiment part of my work as it impacts different mechanical pieces of my site such as tagging and voting, I can branch the page into three areas representing different aspects of the approach in respect to each feature, with and links arrows connecting among these three strains of thought—or maybe a chart listing "features" down one side (tagging, voting, etc.) and how past scholarly attempts (e.g. how other DH projects have experienced crowd-tagging), my usability study (e.g. the reality of crowd-tagging I observe via my user study), and my thought experiment (what I think I might observe if the site actually encountered the speculative state of being annotated and tagged by "everyone") each reflect on that feature.

If this is a bit hard to picture... it's because this is an approach for those times when you really need to be drawing on a whiteboard at the same time as talking, or showing a slide, or otherwise supporting verbal argument with visuals.
<h1>Possible Issues: Accessibility, Effort</h1>
I'll need to do some research into the accessibility of this design approach, but I think that unlike similar-looking sites from years ago (e.g. sites using image slices, Flash, and other early-e-lit-like approaches), the use of clean HTML5 here actually lets the content be extremely screenreader-friendly (well structured, free from cruft). That also means that the core textual content should be easy to print off for purposes of pre-defense comments.

I'll also need to be certain I don't get distracted by the fun of designing/coding this article at the expense of time that could be better spent on other aspects of the dissertation. I think this approach is definitely worth the effort: it's likely to welcome more people to reading my dissertation, and make the dissertation more accessible in multiple senses of the word (available on the web, form/layout supports understanding of arguments, link to further reading on non-literary terms of art such as the HCI terminology I'll be using). Being a really fun thing to do as a web designer is just a happy bonus of the form!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="docs-internal-guid-f1b03647-18d9-905a-86ba-b2f2dad5cd74" dir="ltr">Today, I’m participating in a panel on “What Does a 21st Century Dissertation Look Like?” in the University of Maryland English Department; we’ll explore various ways of conceiving a humanities dissertation other than the traditional monograph format. I’ve captured some notes from my talk here, as well as some related tweets and reading on the subject of non-monograph dissertations.</p>
My focus is on digital dissertations that aren’t auxiliary to or duplicated by a monograph, especially those where design and building are the main scholarly methodologies. Note that there are other examples out there of non-digital yet non-monograph humanities dissertations, such as <a href="http://spinweaveandcut.blogspot.com/">Nick Sousanis’ comic-form dissertation</a>, and a number of dissertations that combine a monograph with a digital component (such as <a href="http://drum.lib.umd.edu//handle/1903/9160" target="_blank">Tanya Clement's digital editing and visualizations</a>, or <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/1903/13969" target="_blank">Lisa Rhody’s topic modeling</a>).
<p dir="ltr">A digital dissertation like mine <strong>is one of many equally valid options for dissertations</strong>; <strong>it’s a useful thought exercise for any dissertator to argue for the rightness of their chosen dissertational platform</strong>, regardless of which format they choose. I'm going to talk about the format that was right for my scholarly project, but my specific format is right for a specific intellectual query.</p>
2. I’ve met surprisingly little resistance to choosing a unique format, more curiosity and willingness to understand. Most people are happy to support a project where you’ve obviously thought hard about how best to make your dissertation a contribution to scholarship. I think a lot of the misunderstanding around "whether" digital work can be scholarly stems from the different types of digital work out there ((Also, from Wordles. Wordles!)): sometimes you build a digital tool that requires further (often written) analysis to produce the intended knowledge, and sometimes, as when the intended knowledge deals with the use and effects of digital interfaces, the digital object itself can embody the argument. One study requires a written narrative; the other embeds its narrative.
<h1 dir="ltr">Why my format?</h1>
<p dir="ltr">My primary field of interest is textual studies, a sub-field within literary studies that concerns itself with the scholarly acts of editing and edition-making,  as well as preserving literary texts; more specifically, I’m interested in digital editing, which migrates these traditional scholarly practices to the online world, opening up possibilities for new ways of reading and studying literary texts. Much of the recent activity in textual studies as a discipline has followed this path, as an examination of the program for the annual Society for Textual Scholarship conference would confirm.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The most productive and efficacious (in terms of scholarly impact) way to push the current research, reading, and teaching capabilities of the digital edition further is to actually demonstrate them in practice, through the hands-on work of designing, building, and testing a digital platform for new editing practices. In many respects, my project is not much different from the previously accepted practice of producing a scholarly edition, complete with commentary and editorial apparatus, as a dissertation.</p>
My <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2013/06/25/iufeatures/"><em>Infinite Ulysses</em></a> participatory digital edition pursues a speculative experiment: what if we build an edition and <em>everyone</em> shows up and adds their annotations (interpretations, questions, contextualizations) to the text? Combining an unusually complex text (James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>) with an approach imagining thousands of site users and annotations allows for the exploration of questions from overlapping fields:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Textual studies:</strong> How can we create digital archives and editions that are not just public, but invite and assist participation from both trained academics and the lay person in our love for the nuances of a text’s materiality, history, and meaning?</li>
	<li><strong>Information science:</strong> How can we borrow successful social mechanics from existing online communities (e.g. upvoting, tagging) to create reading and research experiences that adeptly handle not only issues of contextual annotation quantity but also quality, customizing the displayed annotations to the interests and experience of each reader?</li>
	<li><strong>Literary studies:</strong> What happens to complex texts—especially those Modernist novels purposefully authored to be hypertextual, chaotic, and encyclopedic—under heavy and thorough annotation and conversation?</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="docs-internal-guid-f1b03647-18dd-0124-5648-838d2267d7be" dir="ltr">My dissertation’s format</h1>
<p dir="ltr">The deliverables I'm preparing:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The<em> Infinite Ulysses</em> participatory digital edition (Drupal 7 site: theme design, module coding, interface behavior and incorporated user feedback)</li>
	<li>Public code repository and documentation on using my code to build a similar digital edition</li>
	<li>Formal usability study</li>
	<li>Regular blogging on the technical and theorizing processes (on this site!)</li>
	<li>Scholarly digital article built from the blog posts and the usability study (the article will exist as an interactive website that also serves as a gathering point for links to the other pieces of the dissertation; <a title="Designing a digital scholarly article" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2014/03/31/html5scholarlyarticle/">see this post</a> for more on the argument-through-visual-design format of the planned article)</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">The article will include a scholarly introduction and conclusion to the entire body of dissertation research, a log of critical questions and challenges that arose during the design and coding processes, quantitative and qualitative analysis of user testing of the digital edition, and a theoretical discussion situating my work as developing a long tradition of editing and literary theory.</p>

<h1 dir="ltr">How to do something similar</h1>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-f1b03647-18df-bf56-16f9-3a1513cde668" dir="ltr">I’ve written posts on <a title="Five Tips for Getting Started on a Digital Humanities Dissertation" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/10/21/startingadhdissertation/">getting started on a digital dissertation</a> (e.g. what should you do before submitting your prospectus?) and <a title="Digital dissertation deliverables (and how to complete them!)" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2013/08/14/timeandscope/" target="_blank">keeping up with your digital dissertation work</a>. Once you're convinced the format you've chosen is the best way to convey your dissertational argument, you'll want to draft short explanations (about a paragraph each) of what the format you wish to use is (defining any technical terms) and why you need to use it. Then, identify the parties from whom you need buy-in to make the dissertation work (both in terms of getting it officially accepted by the school, and to make sure your advisers are fully behind your decision) and share these drafts with them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At my university, I spoke with my advisor, dissertation committee, and department before submitting my prospectus; I also met with the person in charge of ingesting dissertations at the university library and the dean of the humanities school. Whenever possible, keep a written record of your statement of what your dissertation will consist of as well as these interested parties' agreements to that vision. I'm lucky in encountering thorough support from the people I spoke to, but I've heard of other students having trouble late in the process when different parties expected different amounts of work to be produced for the degree.</p>

<h1 id="docs-internal-guid-f1b03647-191b-d75c-6a01-2d8347cc73ec" dir="ltr">Benefits of a well-chosen dissertation format and/or a non-monograph format</h1>
<p dir="ltr">1.<strong> Justifying the format of your work is a useful thought exercise.</strong> Choose how you best think through and convey your critical thinking so that you end up with the best possible support for your scholarly argument (e.g. I’ve always left seminar discussions with ideas for small digital tools that could answer a question I'm wondering about, so exploring a digital dissertation was obvious for me.)</p>

<ul>
	<li>What format best supports what you’re arguing?</li>
	<li>What format best reaches the most people who can use and build on your work? (other students, scholars, interested public)</li>
	<li>If you used a different format, what would be possible? What would you lose and gain? What would you learn?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">2. Your dissertation isn't just a piece of scholarly work; it's also a representation to your future coworkers and collaborators of <strong>who you are and what you can do</strong>. Use the dissertation to prepare for the job you want:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Consider learning a new skill(s) as part of the process (but see the caveat below): a technical skill (PHP), delivery (develop an informal blogging voice that helps you think through scholarly questions more quickly), etc.</li>
	<li>Use the dissertation to develop polished examples of your existing skills to highlight when on the job market</li>
	<li>Think about practicing job-skills that the degree doesn’t otherwise guarantee you (e.g. collaboration)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="docs-internal-guid-f1b03647-1925-e8c0-c132-8e543db4353e" dir="ltr">Challenges of non-monograph/digital dissertations</h1>
<p dir="ltr">1. You could end up doubling your labor and time to degree, if any of the various parties in the path to a degree (committee, department, grad school...) will only let you pursue a digital component in addition to a monograph, or if you don't clearly set (in writing if possible) the size and scope of your deliverables early in the dissertation process.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. If you're going to learn new skills as part of the dissertation, make sure your goals are reachable without much outside support. The best skills to work on are self-teachable and proximal to current abilities; for example, I'm already a professional web developer with PHP experience, but I'm using the dissertation to try some advanced things with the language.</p>
<p dir="ltr">3. Mentors might not be able to assist or review different forms as they can with a written chapter; it's more likely your advisors will be able to evaluate your end product, but not comment on the cleanliness, security, or critical thinking behind the lines of code (or comparable facets of other dissertational approaches).</p>
<p dir="ltr">4. Does the job you want/places you’re interested in working value the methodologies/forms you’re using if you aren't working on the traditional monograph? Some won’t, and the economic reality is that you're probably okay with taking a job at one of these places.</p>

<ul>
	<li>What do you want in your peer teachers? For example, if you'd want your department to hire fellow teachers who are good and generous collaborators, how is your dissertation supporting that same quality in you?</li>
	<li>If you can't do the type of project you really want to do now, consider that you may never be able to: as an adjunct, junior faculty member, up for tenure review are not more friendly or safe times for innovation.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">5. Dissertating can be lonely: you've reached the point of expertise where there are few people to talk to on your specific topic, and you're done with regular classes. Not sharing a common format with other students amplifies that loneliness and makes benefiting from the assistance that is available (such as writing groups) difficult.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"Those outside DH often underestimate the theoretical sophistication of many in computing, who deal every day, for example, with gaps between complex datamining algorithms and the practical sources of those data, or with the production of multiple, sometimes contradictory, visualizations from the same dataset.

		<title>Notes from an Islandora Installation (aka Islandora Digital Edition Brain Dump)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently spent some time installing <a href="http://islandora.ca/" target="_blank">Islandora</a> (Drupal 7 plus a Fedora Commons repository = open-source, best-practices framework for managing institutional collections) as part of my digital dissertation work, with the goal of using the <a href="http://editingmodernism.ca/" target="_blank">Editing Modernism in Canada</a> (EMiC) digital edition modules (<a href="https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_critical_edition" target="_blank">Islandora Critical Edition</a> and <a href="https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_critical_edition_advanced" target="_blank">Critical Edition Advanced</a>) as a platform for my <a title="Infinite Ulysses: Planned Features for a Participatory Edition" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2013/06/25/iufeatures/" target="_blank">Infinite Ulysses</a> participatory digital edition.
<h1>Why Islandora?</h1>
For various reasons having to do with the focus and scope of my particular dissertational project, I didn't ultimately end up using Islandora or the EMiC modules for my digital edition ((e.g. I don't need the Fedora Commons extra database and collection management abilities to work with my single text, and I need installation to be lightweight and easy so others can replicate my site))—but I spent enough time with them to know they're fantastic tools for creating an online scholarly collection of critical text- or image-based editions. Here's some highlights of what Islandora plus the EMiC modules can let you do:
<ul>
	<li>Upload and OCR your texts!</li>
	<li>Batch ingest of pages of a book or newspaper</li>
	<li>TEI and RDF encoding GUI (incorporating the magic of <a href="http://www.cwrc.ca/projects/infrastructure-projects/technical-projects/cwrc-writer/" target="_blank">CWRC-Writer within Drupal</a>)</li>
	<li>Highlight words/phrases of text—or circle/rectangle/draw a line around parts of a facsimile image—and add textual annotations</li>
	<li>Internet Archive reader for your finished edition! (flip-pages animation, autoplay, zoom)</li>
	<li>A <a href="http://www.fedora-commons.org/" target="_blank">Fedora Commons repository</a> managing your digital objects</li>
</ul>
Plus, <a href="https://github.com/Islandora?query=" target="_blank">Islandora has a slew of active repositories</a> for additional features, such as integrating Solr search and ingesting web archives, as well as <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/ISLANDORA712/Solution+Packs" target="_blank">solution packs</a> for handling many types of digital object (newspapers, large images, audio, PDFs, video...)
<h1>How do I set it up?</h1>
You'd want to start with <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/ISLANDORA712/Islandora" target="_blank">the Islandora wiki </a>for both installation instructions and answers as to what Islandora is and what it can do; there's also the <a href="http://islandora.ca" target="_blank">main Islandora site</a>. Other places to look for help include the main <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/islandora" target="_blank">Islandora listerv</a> for Islandora users, the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/islandora-dev" target="_blank">Islandora Dev listserv</a> (if you're looking for help in developing on Islandora), and listservs for any particular pieces of the installation process that give you trouble (e.g. I found the <a href="http://www.fedora-commons.org/community/developers/devlist" target="_blank">Fedora Commons developer mailing list</a> and the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/djatoka/index.php?title=Main_Page" target="_blank">Adore Djatoka wiki</a> helpful, as well as <a href="http://asingh.com.np/blog/fedora-commons-installation-and-configuration-guide/" target="_blank">this blog post on Fedora set-up</a>).

<strong>BUT FIRST!</strong> While the Islandora wiki instructions will help you install Islandora on your own server, I'd highly recommend trying two other tactics first—because regular installation requires a lot of sysadminy folderol (fine and great fun if you're a sysadmin or interested+have the time in picking up some new knowledge in that area). Islandora's a fantastic platform, but the main problems I ran into while installing and playing with it were server configuration ones: finding the right paths, selecting the right versions of software, setting permissions correctly.

I didn't find that following the wiki straight through resulted in a working site; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> to find fault with the official documentation, though!: documentation is very difficult with a thing like Islandora because many server configs are different, dependencies develop new versions, packages cease to be available ((Something I've learned from creating user documentation for BitCurator is that we have to write documentation for things not even in our suite of tools or they can be major stumbling blocks to people using our software—stuff like getting 7-zip to decompress a file, or VirtualBox to recognize a given USB stick)). The page on <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/ISLANDORA711/Installing+Solr+and+GSearch" target="_blank">setting up Solr and gSearch</a> was a particular stumbling point for me and others, and I'd recommend you'd start by reading the comments at the bottom and then doing a quick search on the Islandora listserv when you get there.
<h1>Start Here!</h1>
1. I'd strongly recommend playing around with Islandora using the <a href="http://islandora.ca/downloads" target="_blank">virtual image</a> they offer (bottom of the page) to make sure it's right for your needs.

2. Then, consider forgoing the wiki instruction route for this "<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/islandora/mEz2KAgVUs4" target="_blank">one-click automated Islandora install</a>". I haven't tried it myself (it became available after I'd switch over to plain Drupal 7), but various users have chimed in on that thread that it works, or with questions when they ran into issues (that were quickly answered by the community). You'll need to learn Vagrant and Chef to make this route work, but that should both <em>a)</em> be less work than learning how to so the server config stuff you'd need to do for the Islandora install otherwise, and <em>b)</em> be really great in the long run for your Islandora site (Vagrant lets you not mess with the system configuration on your host computer and quickly deploy a local dev site to the public). Also, it looks like that thread instructs you on the stuff you'd need to learn about Vagrant/Chef.
<h1>Setting up Islandora without Vagrant or the VM: Random Notes</h1>
If you want to set up Islandora using the wiki instructions (rather than using the Vagrant route mentioned above), I've compiled below random notes I took during my set-up process. These are meant as supplementary to the Islandora wiki and listserv and in no way can be followed on their own to set up your site—but it seemed worthwhile to share somewhere as one possible reference if you run into issues while setting up your Islandora site. Caveat emptor: as I mentioned, I'm no longer working on an Islandora site for my dissertation project, so I won't be able to answer any Islandora-y questions. If you do have any questions specifically about using Islandora for digital edition sites, <a href="http://editingmodernism.ca/contact-us/" target="_blank">get in contact with the excellent people at Editing Modernism in Canada</a>, who have been developing the modules to add those editing capabilities.
<h2>My Server Set-Up</h2>
I used <a href="https://www.linode.com/" target="_blank">Linode</a> to set up Virtual Private Server (VPS) with Islandora and was very happy with their services. If you're used to using regular web hosting, the difference with a VPS is that you have access to a "whole server", so you can fiddle around with what version of PHP is installed, etc. Linode was not only reliable and fairly-priced, they have <a href="https://library.linode.com/" target="_blank">truly amazing documentation</a> on how to set up your server—so don't be hesitant over creating your own Islandora site just because you've never used a VPS or set up a server before—Linode can walk you through it. Additionally, there's <a href="http://feross.org/how-to-setup-your-linode/" target="_blank">this blog post</a> by Feross Aboukhadijeh on "How To Set Up Your Linode For Maximum Awesomeness" to further help you with your Linode set-up. I'd recommend starting by getting a basic Ubuntu 12.04 server set-up by following the Linode instructions (also check out their set of "stackscripts" that automate things like setting up LAMP on your server).
<h2>Random Notes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I found it extremely helpful to keep a written log of everything I was doing: things I tried, files I altered, paths to error logs I'd want to be checking, tutorials I'd tried (I also started auto-saving my command line input). I decided to cut a lot of that out for this post because it was very specific to my server config and needs (and also contained some trial and error and exasperated comments...), but I'd strongly encourage you to do the same. I'd never forced myself to keep such thorough notes on what I was doing before, and I'll be doing it in all my tech work from now on. You're going to have a million passwords you'll need to record anyway (Tomcat user, Drupal, Drupal database, Fedora database...)</li>
	<li>Always check out the ReadMe for any Islandora/EMiC module you're installing (i.e. on the GitHub repository page for the module, scroll down past the file list to read the text, or look for the text file labeled README in the module folder you downloaded). There are often additional instructions beyond the usual way you install a module (e.g. dependencies to install, permissions to set).</li>
	<li>I wanted to use the Drupal maintenance page module to hide my site from the public, but this prevented me from setting clean URLs on the site, which is required to make Islandora work.</li>
	<li>I started seeing a problem where Fedora kept crashing/closing down on its own (which I could see by going to the yoursite.com:8080/fedora/admin page and not seeing the Fedora dashboard. This was solved by adding more memory to the server (i.e. purchasing a higher Linode plan, in my case).</li>
	<li>Be mindful of what pieces of the platform need what version of Java. Running $FEDORA_HOME/tomcat/bin/startup.sh at one point, the output showed me that my JRE_HOME variable was pointing at the Java 6 OpenJDK, when it needed to be accessing the Sun JRE. I have a hazy memory that there's one piece of the Islandora set-up that requires one version of Java, and another that needs a different version.</li>
	<li>Some random "where is that again?" notes:
<ul>
	<li>yoursite.com:8080/fedora/admin (your Fedora Repository admin dashboard)</li>
	<li>yoursite.com:8080/fedoragsearch (your Fedora gSearch admin; credentials are set in $FEDORA_HOME/server/config/fedora-users.xml)</li>
	<li>yoursite.com:8080 (your Tomcat manager; set an admin user in $CATALINA_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml and you can log in to view various processes running on your server)</li>
	<li>Check out $FEDORA_HOME/data/fedora-xacml-policies/repository-policies to make sure your Fedora access policies are secure</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<em>/end brain dump</em>

<em></em>I'll be posting details of my current digital edition tech stack/set-up soon (and eventually there should be thorough, user-friendly documentation on creating a participatory digital edition of your own with capabilities like mine will have).]]></content:encoded>

We started using Islandora for a digital humanities initiative here at Hamilton College and are planning on putting our library's digital collections in it as well.

We already have one TEI project on Islandora (Drupal 6)
http://cwl.dhinitiative.org/ (TEI still needs some cleanup, alas)
but we now use Islandora (D7) for new collections and hope soon to start using the Islandora Critical Edition module for some upcoming TEI projects. I look forward to reading your future posts on your experience with this module.

<h2>"What if we build a digital edition and everyone shows up? Public Humanities, Participatory Design, and Infinite Ulysses"</h2>
(transcript of talk delivered at <a title="Upcoming Talk @Nebraska Forum on Digital Humanities 2014" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2014/03/26/upcomingnebraskatalk/" target="_blank">Nebraska DH Forum 2014</a>)

[caption id="attachment_3483" align="aligncenter" width="409"]<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/newlogo2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3483" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/newlogo2.jpg" alt="Draft of logo for Infinite Ulysses site" width="409" height="175" /></a> Draft of logo for Infinite Ulysses site[/caption]

What if we build a digital edition and everyone (millions of scholars, first-time readers, book clubs, teachers and their students) shows up and annotates the text with their infinite interpretations, questions, and contextualizations? The “Infinite <i>Ulysses</i>” project pursues this speculative experiment, and today I'm going to talk about how this unlikely hypothetical is helping me study and improve DH interface usability.

Textual scholar Morris Eaves conceives of editions not just as vessels for textual content, but as “problem-solving mechanisms”; and I'm using this speculative edition experiment to both
<ul>
	<li>produce something practically useful, designing and coding an actual digital edition of James Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i> with a number of experimental interface features, and then</li>
	<li>conducting use and usability testing with real readers and researchers to focus on three interrelated lines of questioning:</li>
</ul>
<b>1. First, a question about how such an experiment can benefit the humanities:</b> How can we design digital archives and editions that are not just public, but invite and assist participation from both trained academics and the lay person in our love for the nuances of a text’s materiality, history, and meaning?

<b>2. Second, a question about how we make such a thing as my speculative idea work:</b> How can we borrow successful social mechanics from existing online communities (things like upvoting &amp; tagging) to create reading and research experiences that adeptly handle not only issues of user-generated contextual annotation quantity but also quality?

<b>3. And third, a question about how this interface work affects the texts at its core: </b>What happens to complex texts—especially those purposefully authored to be hypertextual, chaotic, and encyclopedic, like <i>Ulysses</i>—when a participatory digital edition places them under heavy and thorough annotation and conversation?
<h2>Some Quick Definitions</h2>
I'll be discussing how scholarly digital edition development helps us look at these three questions, and I'll also address how the overall Infinite <i>Ulysses</i> project functions as an unusually shaped humanities dissertation. Before I go any further, though, I want to define some words I'll be using a lot:

The "<b>digital editions</b>" I'm talking about are literary or other texts that have been prepared for online reading and research by a scholarly editor according to a carefully constructed interpretation and methodology. These are digital editions like those on the <i>Whitman</i> or <i>Shelley-Godwin Archives</i>, rather than the digitized/scanned and non-interpreted texts you find on Google Books.

I'll also be talking about "<b>annotations</b>" a lot. When a reader "annotates" my digital edition, they're highlighting a word, phrase, or other section of the literary text, then typing in a comment on that highlighting. This annotation then appears in the margin of the text depending on some other factors.

Finally, I'll be talking about "<b>speculative design</b>", a design approach that imagines future challenges and opportunities, and builds design solutions both imbued with theoretical innovation and the possibility of future utility. It's a way of using hypotheticals to make connections you might not otherwise make. My designing a digital edition that could handle a hypothetical public wildly interested in annotating a complex text is a speculative experiment that's helping me think about customizing annotations to individual researchers, and about how heavy annotation changes an unwieldy text like Ulysses.
<h2>Participatory, Public</h2>
Scholarly editor Gary Taylor has asked : “How can you love a work, if you don’t know it? How can you know it, if you can’t get near it? How can you get near it, without editors?” Scholarly editors are an integral part of the continuum that keeps the stories of the past available to and understood by the present—but just as important in Taylor’s formulation is the you, that public of not just scholars, but also readers in and beyond the academy whose interest keeps the humanities alive and relevant.

Lindsey Thomas notes that "making something freely available online does not necessarily guarantee that thing is public, or that it will be used as a public resource" ((<span class="s1">"</span><span class="s2">Making something freely available online does not necessarily guarantee that thing is public<b>,</b></span><span class="s1"> or that it will be used as a public resource...'Openness,' as we tend to understand the term in the Digital Humanities, might not necessarily involve 'making public' as we are used to thinking about it." </span>— Lindsey C. Thomas, "<a href="http://dhpoco.org/blog/2013/12/16/open-access-and-the-digital-humanities/" target="_blank">Open Access and the Digital Humanities</a>")). I'm interested in building tools and digital editions that help both textual scholars and the lay person participate in our love for the nuances of a text; and I'm especially interested in how we can use interface design to encourage not just consumption of, but participation in the humanities.

One way of thinking about participatory platforms is as a classroom. What's the connection between teaching and editions?
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span class="s1">"[Nobel-Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman] prided himself on being able to devise ways to explain even the most profound ideas to beginning students. Once, I said to him, ‘Dick, explain to me, so that I can understand it, why spin one-half particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics.’ ...Feynman said, ‘I’ll prepare a freshman lecture on it.’ </span><span class="s2"><b>But he came back a few days later to say, ‘I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t reduce it to the freshman level. That means we don’t really understand it.‘</b></span><span class="s1">" </span><em>— David L. Goodstein, in Feynman’s Lost Lecture: The Motion of Planets Around the Sun </em></p>
I like how this Feynman quotation expresses that teaching is knowing, that we learn something more intimately when compelled to make our knowledge declarative for others, and if we're not able to teach a thing, then we might not know it as well as we thought. When I think about designing welcoming digital editions and other digital humanities sites, I often think about how we can make them more like a really good graduate seminar experience, where scaffolded discussion helps you think and discuss better.

The flip side to the metaphor of a classroom as a participatory space is that many digital editions are kind of participatory once removed. By aiming their content at teachers with things like teaching guides and sample assignments, they do a great job at humanities outreach, but the learning and discussion usually happens off the actual digital project site, and thus doesn't feed into the experience of other users.
<h2>Participatory Design</h2>
I've just discussed a more loose way of thinking about "participatory" design. There's also a more rigorous definition for participatory design that comes from the field of human-computer interaction (or HCI). HCI, a field focused on interfaces between user and computer (including interfaces of reading and research), provides this useful approach to a humanities that simultaneously benefits the public and scholars. Participatory design is an approach not just centered on the scholar or just on the public, but finessing the “third space” of discussion and shared learning that exists when the two groups come into conversation; Michael Muller has found that results can include “challenging assumptions, learning reciprocally, and creating new ideas, which emerge through negotiation and co-creation of identities, working languages, understandings, and relationships, and polyvocal dialogues across and through differences" ((Michael J. Muller. “Participatory Design: The Third Space in HCI”. In The Human-Computer Interaction Handbook. 1051-1068.)).

Some sites and projects are intended "primarily with scholars in mind", and these are necessary and important contributions to the academy and human knowledge. On the other hand, I feel like non-designers are too quick to repeat the cliched "you can't design for multiple audiences", instead of thinking "<b>how do I design for this space where we learn together?</b>" For example, in a formal usability study of public use of several key digital archives, I found that it was often very simple interface changes users desired in order to be able to understand and use a DH site. When we bring the public into our scholarly conversations, everyone can benefit, and it's important to remember that designing for interactive participation and pedagogy is itself a scholarly activity that also benefits the public.
<h2>Infinite Ulysses: What's It Going to Look Like?</h2>
Let's turn to the Infinite <i>Ulysses</i> digital edition and how I'm designing it to be participatory. Here's the simple version of what my edition will let scholars and readers do: read the text online on their laptop, iPad, or tablet; when they run into something in their reading, whether that's a question, or an interpretation or context they wish to share, or an answer for a question left by another reader, they'll be able to highlight that piece of the text and add that as an annotation, which will then show up to the side of the text. Readers can also add tags to these annotations and up- or down-vote them, as well as have the option to fill out site profiles with fields for research interests, whether you've read the text before, and other details to aid in site customization.

I'm not going to demo the site because I've been focusing on coding the interface behavior and not on the final theming design yet. The final site won't look like this, but it's a general sense of the layout:

<ul>
	<li>a central column of reading text</li>
	<li>a drawer on the right for creating and reading annotations</li>
	<li>a drawer on the left for customizing your view of the text</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fun Potential Issues with which I'll Be Dealing!</h2>
This project combines its speculative design approach with the scholarly primitive of curation (dealing with information abundance and quality and bias), imagining scholarly digital editions as popular sites of interpretation and conversation around a text. Of course, with our hypothetical millions of users and annotations, we can't display all of them next to the text, and you'd quickly see the entire text covered in a single block of yellow highlighting if we left everything highlighted that ever got annotated. By drawing from examples of how people actually interact with text on the internet, such as on the social community Reddit and the Q&amp;A StackExchange sites, I’m creating a digital edition interface that allows site visitors to create and interact with a potentially high number of annotations and interpretations of the text.

The big questions I'm trying to answer with this interface design are:
<ul>
	<li>If everyone’s submitting annotations to a digital edition, how can we automate the massive task of curation and moderation so that it occurs in a timely and unbiased manner?</li>
	<li>And once we’ve separated the wheat of critical yet diverse annotations from the chaff of repetitions, spam, and under-substantiated suggestions, how do we make the still-plentiful remaining material accessible to the users it would best serve?</li>
	<li>That is, how do we separate the signal from the noise when the “signal” of pertinent contextual annotations means different things for different reader needs?</li>
</ul>
My project is testing out to what degree using tags, upvoting, and profile information can help customize the reading experience for each reader. The hypothetical here is that we're able to filter the annotations to match the level of help a person needs, or their research interests; and, when there are still too many annotations available for a given word or phrase, at least cycle randomly through better subsets of annotations than the entire available pool. I've been coding to follow what seems to work best for existing successful online communities, including by visiting these communities' spaces for meta-analysis such as the subreddit "theory of reddit", but we won't know how well this works with a digital edition until I begin my usability testing this fall.
<h2>Site Features</h2>
I won't read through all the examples of functions I've been coding for (<a title="Infinite Ulysses: Planned Features for a Participatory Edition" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2013/06/25/iufeatures/" target="_blank">you can read a full list in this post</a>), but here are a few examples of things you should be able to do with the edition:
<ol>
	<li>filter the annotations to only show those on particular areas of interest (e.g. annotations that translate foreign words, or annotations aimed at first-time readers)</li>
	<li>filter out annotations the reader doesn’t want to see (e.g. spoilers about something that only becomes clear later in the book)</li>
	<li>easily create a curated “edition” of <i>Ulysses</i> showing only annotations aimed at a specific topic (e.g. an edition meant for use by a class focusing on the place of books, letters, newspapers, and other written material in the Modernist novel), and/or only see annotations added by specific users, such as members of a class or book club</li>
</ol>
So, will we get enough annotations, tagging, and voting to make the site work? Even if the site doesn't have many more annotations and tags than the base set provided by me and several contributing scholars, it'll still be a useful public site. Some years back, I built a prototype non-participatory digital edition of <i>Ulysses</i> that was much simpler, but dealt with similar questions of interface design for ease of <i>Ulysses</i> first-time reading; unfortunately it's now very technically dated and has a frightening color palette; I still hear from random people around the world that they've read its two chapters of <i>Ulysses</i> and want more, though, so I do think there is already a desire for a certain way of presenting <i>Ulysses</i> online with annotation. I'm really hoping to be able to support a resource that is not only read, though, but also participated in, so that we can hear many more voices in our discussion of <i>Ulysses</i>.
<h2>Will Readers Tag?</h2>
The LibraryThing blog has <a href="http://goo.gl/FGJRrC" target="_blank">a great article on how people tag things for themselves</a>, not just because a site offers it, for personal reasons like aiding in memory and socializing. LibraryThing has found success with users tagging books, while Amazon's book tagging feature has failed (I didn't even know you could tag books!). I choose <i>Ulysses</i> for my test text in part because it occupies a special position: difficult enough that people welcome help in reading it, yet still very much in the popular consciousness as something that can and should be read (as opposed to, say, Finnegans Wake). People tweet about trying to read <i>Ulysses</i> all the time, hold reunions with book clubs with whom they read the text in the past, and celebrate the <i>Ulysses</i> holiday of Bloomsday every June. There's an audience out there to support with such a site, and I'm expecting that people will use the site's features in a way that benefits themselves but also others, whether they choose to annotate and tag and vote to interact with people they know offline like book clubs, or want to create a customized annotated edition for teaching or research use, or want to help track clues throughout the book, or otherwise serve the same purpose as sticky notes and penciled marginalia in print books.
<h2>Digital Humanities Use and Usability</h2>
I'll be conducting both use and usability studies to understand and build from user feedback. Usability is concerned with whether the site lets users simply and intuitively do what the site is meant to do—that is, read <i>Ulysses</i> and participate in a discussion around it. To study this, I can for example see how much time or how many clicks it takes a user to get to the text and add a question or other annotation. Use is the equally interesting study of how people actually use the site; do they want to tag annotations? do they want to do unexpected things like literary role-playing using the annotations? To some extent, I've tried to design for expected "non-official" uses, such as realizing that people would use the annotation feature to ask questions and supporting it both by allowing filtering for questions and answers, and creating a link to a feed of all unanswered questions.
<h2>Literary Texts under Participation</h2>
The third question this project is helping me explore is about <i>Ulysses</i> itself. What happens to complex texts—especially those purposefully authored to be hypertextual, chaotic, and encyclopedic—under heavy and thorough annotation and conversation?

My project builds on previous Joycean contextualizing work: such as Blamire’s Bloomsday Book and Gifford’s <i>Ulysses</i> Annotated. Previous contextualizations (especially those on a higher, more macro-level of understanding the basics of <i>Ulysses</i> rather than specific allusions) carry an increased risk of authorial bias because of their individual authorship (e.g. the Bloomsday Book is very interested in charting Bloom’s development as a Christ figure); while the sources I’ve named are all excellent and useful pieces of scholarship that have improved my enjoyment of the novel, I’m very interested in seeing how a participatory edition might moderate among a variety of higher-level contextual interpretations and whether we might thus prevent a canon of interpretation from calcifying around the text, or at least multiple popular key streams of thinking around the text within the same digital space. <i>Ulysses</i> is also an interesting contextualization problem in that there are many sets of contextualizations floating around the web from both scholars and amateurs (in the old and new senses of the word); I’m interested in bringing diverse sets of interpretation together in one place and seeing how they overlap or contend with one another.

Some key print precedents for this project are variorum and other editions that deal with a large quantity of variants, marginalia, or other annotation, such as the Shelley-Godwin manuscript notebooks and Hans Gabler’s synoptic <i>Ulysses</i> edition; these last two examples have convenient digital counterparts in Michael Groden’s never-finished <i>Ulysses</i> in Hypermedia prototype, and the developing Shelley-Godwin Archive.
<h2>Ulysses + Hyperannotation = ???</h2>
While there isn’t a complete critical digital edition of <i>Ulysses</i> yet published, that hasn’t kept Joycean scholars from anticipating issues that might arise with the eventual migration to digital space. Where the limitations of print space have in the past kept annotations of the text in check, what will happen when a digital platform allows the addition and navigation of infinite annotations? Can we migrate complex print hypertexts such as <i>Ulysses</i> to a digital space with socially multiplied annotations without, as Mark Marino wonders, “diminish[ing] the force of the book”? Marino asks, "Assuming it were possible, would the creation of a system that automatically makes available all the allusions, unravels all the riddles, and translates foreign languages normalize Joyce’s text?"

Derek Attridge similarly sees a risk in <i>Ulysses</i>' hypertextualization and hyperannotation, saying "[<i>Ulysses</i>'] cultural supremacy, and the scholarly efforts which reflect and promote that supremacy, have turned it into a text that confirms us in our satisfied certainties instead of one that startles and defies us and thus opens new avenues for thought and pleasure. It now provides a spurious sense of rich complexity by reducing differences and distinctions".

Yet Attridge also sees space for promise in the digital development of the text, saying "The very magnitude of the encyclopedic Joycean hypertext can itself be unsettling… and it may be possible to produce a hypermedia version of <i>Ulysses</i> that is anything but reassuring—one that revives, in new ways, the provocations and disturbances of the original publication… The best teachers (like the best critics) are those who find ways to sustain the disruptive force of <i>Ulysses</i> even while they do their necessary work of explaining and demystifying". I'm hoping that by going back to my earlier definition of a participatory edition—one that functions like a classroom—we might be able to collectively make <i>Ulysses</i>' chaotic wonder accessible to more people, without also dampening that wonder.

So, despite there being no full digital edition of <i>Ulysses</i> against which to test these fears and assumptions about hypertextualization, we already have some questions about what happens to a complex Modernist text when “everyone shows up”, and I’m hoping that by creating a site that experiments with allowing “infinite” contextual annotation of <i>Ulysses</i>, we can get a more realistic picture of what extreme annotation actually does to our experience of the text. When even <i>Ulysses</i> editor Hans Gabler says he still learns new things about <i>Ulysses</i> from time to time, I’m confident that <i>Ulysses</i> will persist as always partially unfixed, always giving back more.
<h2>How does this work as a dissertation?</h2>
The Infinite <i>Ulysses</i> digital edition is a dissertational project. In addition to the Drupal edition site, which will include the theme design, module coding in JS and PHP, and incorporated user feedback, the overall project has four other deliverables:
<ol>
	<li>Public code repository and documentation on using my code to build a similar digital edition</li>
	<li>Formal usability study</li>
	<li>Regular blogging on the technical and theorizing processes</li>
	<li>Scholarly digital article built from the blog posts and the usability study</li>
</ol>
So why this format and these methodologies? My primary field of interest is textual studies, a sub-field within literary studies that concerns itself with the scholarly acts of editing and edition-making, as well as preserving literary texts; more specifically, I’m interested in digital editing, which migrates these traditional scholarly practices to the online world, opening up possibilities for new ways of reading and studying literary texts. Much of the recent activity in textual studies as a discipline has followed this path, as an examination of the program for the annual Society for Textual Scholarship conference would confirm.

I feel that the most productive and efficacious (in terms of scholarly impact) way to push the current research, reading, and teaching capabilities of the digital edition further is to actually demonstrate them in practice, through the hands-on work of designing, building, and testing a digital platform for new editing practices. In many respects, my project is not much different from the previously accepted practice of producing for the literature dissertation a scholarly edition, complete with commentary and editorial apparatus.

In a field concerned with scholarly editing and edition-making, we need editions that experiment boldly not <i>only </i>with the editing of texts, but also with the crafting of those textual frames, treating the edition interface as an argument and meta-text worthy of experimentation and innovation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here's a quick, three-minute video about my dissertational project:

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/92430744?byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="500" height="375" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

If you want to know more, <a title="My Digital Dissertation: Public Humanities, Participatory Design, and Infinite Ulysses" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2014/04/20/my-digital-dissertation-update/">the recent talk I gave at the Nebraska DH Forum</a> is pretty thorough, or you can <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/category/dissertation/" target="_blank">check out the feed of blog posts I've been writing as I work on the project</a>. That sign-up form link at the end is <a href="http://goo.gl/qtcy6" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/qtcy6</a> !

Here's a transcript of the video:

I’m designing, coding, and user-testing digital social reading interfaces for my literature doctoral dissertation. This is a novel approach; rather than write the traditional four-chapter monograph, my dissertation will consist of four pieces:
<ol>
	<li>The Infinite Ulysses participatory digital edition website</li>
	<li>Formal usability testing with volunteers reading Ulysses via my website</li>
	<li>Research blogging on the process of scholarly building throughout the entire dissertation, and</li>
	<li>A multimedia scholarly article</li>
</ol>
I'm using the site to pursue three main research questions:

1. How can we design digital archives and editions that are not just public, but invite and assist participation from both trained academics and non-academics in our love for the nuances of a text’s history and interpretation?

2. How can we borrow successful social mechanics from existing online communities (things like upvoting and tagging) to create reading experiences that adeptly handle not only issues of user-generated annotation quantity but also quality?

3. What happens to complex texts—especially those purposefully authored to be hypertextual, chaotic, and encyclopedic, like Ulysses—when a participatory digital edition places them under heavy and thorough annotation and conversation?

Let's turn to discussing the site itself. Here's the simple version of what my edition will let scholars and readers do: read the text online on their laptop, iPad, or tablet; when they run into something in their reading, whether that's a question, or an interpretation or context they wish to share, or an answer for a question left by another reader, they'll be able to highlight that piece of the text and add that as an annotation, which will then show up to the side of the text (like marginalia). Readers can also add tags to these annotations and up- or down-vote them, as well as have the option to fill out user profiles with fields for research interests, whether you've read the text before, and other details to aid in site customization for each reader's interests, background, and reading habits.

I won't read through all the examples what the site will be able to do (you can <a title="Infinite Ulysses: Planned Features for a Participatory Edition" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2013/06/25/iufeatures/" target="_blank">read a full list on this blog post</a>), but here are a few examples of things you'll be able to do on the Infinite Ulysses site:
<ul>
	<li>You can filter the annotations on the novel to only show those notes on particular areas of interest to you (e.g. annotations that translate foreign words, or annotations aimed at first-time readers)</li>
	<li>You can filter <em>out</em> annotations you don't want to see (e.g. spoilers about something that only becomes clear later in the book)</li>
	<li>And, you can easily create your own customized reading edition of Ulysses that shows only annotations aimed at a specific topic (e.g. an edition meant for use by a class focusing on the place of books, letters, and other written material in the Modernist novel), and/or only see annotations added by specific users, such as members of your literature class or book club</li>
</ul>
The site will open up for testing with individual volunteer readers this Fall 2014, and beta testing with teachers and their students, and book clubs, in early Spring 2015. I'm looking for volunteers with any interest in reading Ulysses, whether you've never read a word of it or are a Joycean scholar. You can <a href="http://goo.gl/qtcy6" target="_blank">sign up to be notified when the site goes live at by filling out this form</a>, or feel free to tweet me <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Literature_Geek" target="_blank">@Literature_Geek</a> with any questions or follow me to hear when the website goes live.

Please visit my research blog, <a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com" target="_blank">LiteratureGeek.com</a>, to read more. Thanks for watching!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Affinity of ideas: Using an affinity wall to map out my digital dissertation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_diagram" target="_blank">affinity wall (diagram, chart)</a> is a technique I picked up while doing some contextual inquiry consulting as part of my information master's. It's a way to take a bunch of separate ideas and visually map out how they're related (thus, "affinity"); this helps your areas of focus (or paper section headings) rise organically out of an overview of all the things you want to cover, rather than being pushed onto the ideas from the top down.

[caption id="attachment_3561" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<img class="size-full wp-image-3561" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_0498.jpg" alt="The dry-erase board before I started (in the corner are topics I'd need to cover at the end of the project, after user testing)." width="300" height="199" /> The dry-erase board before I started (in the corner are topics I'd need to cover at the end of the project, after user testing).[/caption]

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/44466253@N07/" target="_blank">I first used affinity mapping</a> to figure out how a system (tech support ticketing software for a nursing department) actually worked, mapping my observations from being embedded in a workplace environment, instead of just relying on interviews and staff views on what they thought was going on. Now, I'm using it to figure out how all the things I want to think about and say as part of dissertation project can come together in one scholarly journal article. (<em>Note that photos are deliberately small, as I'm not completely comfortable with posting a detailed outline of an eventual journal article</em>.)

[caption id="attachment_3560" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<img class="size-full wp-image-3560" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_0501.jpg" alt="Post-it notes grouped by topic on the affinity wall dry-erase board." width="300" height="372" /> The first grouping of topics on the affinity board.[/caption]

Text version at end of post." width="400" height="476" /> A close-up on the topics I drew out of my affinity groupings. Text version at end of post.[/caption]
<h2>How to Make an Affinity Wall</h2>
The technique is simple: get a couple packs of post-it notes and an empty wall or board. Write down one idea per post-it, only using a few words (if you need more, you should probably break the thought into more post-it notes); you can use different colors of post-it if you want to keep track of some factor such as whether the idea came from an interview, an observation, a Twitter conversation, or a book. Once you've written everything out, start to group things together in ways that make sense, without trying to impose some pre-decided groupings on the ideas.

[caption id="attachment_3559" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<img class="size-full wp-image-3559" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_0506.jpg" alt="The final affinity wall, with post-its grouped by topic and ordered within those topics." width="400" height="354" /> The final affinity wall, with post-its grouped by topic and ordered within those topics.[/caption]
<h2>Affinity Wall to Journal Article</h2>
The actual dissertation deliverable for this article is only a polished draft; we're not tying its acceptance or publication into the evaluation process. I'm expecting to write sections that won't be submitted when I share the piece with a journal, so I tried not to think about whether there would be enough space to cover a topic in the final article; in the paper I share at my defense, I'll just flag any sections that will drop out before sending the article to a journal.

The affinity wall also covered content I needed to write that wouldn't fit in even the longest article: things I needed to think through via writing and research, and content I want on the site (e.g. a short background on Joyce and the writing of Ulysses, a moderation policy, and addressing the IP rights of site users). I bracketed on the side of the board any topics that would only appear as written content on the website not in the journal article) or for pieces I could only write after my user testing. This left me with nine main sections of writing and thinking that I can work on right now as I'm building the website. Once those nine topics were chosen, I was able to arrange the post-its beneath the headings in an order that makes narrative sense.
<h2>Tackling the Writing</h2>
My next step will be to mark every post-it that I've already begun to address. The point isn't to cross things off a list once I've blogged about them once. Rather, the wall lets me make certain I'm spending time thinking about all the major sections of the project; I mark a post-it note once (one diagonal line across) when I've thought and written enough about a topic that I've produced a blog post, and twice (making an X across the post-it square) when I've done enough work that my writing on the topic is ready for pulling into a draft of the journal article.

Here are the nine main sections I ended up with, in case they're hard to read on the photos ((Again, these are deliberately non-zoomable as I'm not completely comfortable with showing the world a detailed outline of an article I'll be working on for the next year)):
<ol>
	<li>Lit review and project precedents</li>
	<li>Speculative experiment to practical outcome</li>
	<li>Dissertation format and methodology</li>
	<li>Tech decisions</li>
	<li>"Edition"? (addressing what an edition is and if my website is one)</li>
	<li>Metaphors for participatory editions (e.g. <a title="Living Editions: What Seminars Can Teach Us About Building Digital Editions" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/11/06/livingeditions/" target="_blank">my post on classrooms as participatory editions</a>)</li>
	<li>Inclusivity</li>
	<li>Accessibility</li>
	<li>Learning from existing online communities (e.g. <a title="Cat GIFs &amp; Mrkgnao: Ulysses, Reddit, and What Digital Editions Can Learn from Online Communities" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2013/07/29/redditulysses/" target="_blank">my post on what digital editions can learn from Reddit and StackExchange</a>)</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For the next academic year, I'll be in residence at MITH (the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities, a digital humanities think tank) as the <a href="http://mith.umd.edu/mith-welcomes-amanda-visconti-as-winnemore-fellow/" target="_blank">Winnemore Digital Dissertation Fellow</a>. The fellowship will support <a title="Digital Dissertation" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/digital-dissertation/" target="_blank">my digital dissertation work</a> and wrap up with a Digital Dialogue presentation in the spring.

MITH has been integral to my development as a digital humanist, functioning like a second academic department and helping me gain experience in diverse subfields of DH (e.g. web development, digital archives, digital pedagogy, usability testing, and technical documentation)—I'm really grateful for this capstone opportunity! I'll be blogging more about the fellowship here as well as on <a href="http://mith.umd.edu" target="_blank">the MITH blog</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Attending the Scholars' Lab/NEH <a href="http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/" target="_blank"><em>Speaking in Code</em> symposium </a>emphasized for me how much of a research developer's work involves tacit knowledge, and this opacity extends to scholars in general when it comes to how stuff—books, articles, projects—get made. You get semi-polished glimpses of a work becoming itself, from its beginnings (grant applications, abstracts) to the draft stage (actual drafts, as well as blog posts and conference talks feeling out the research) to the end point (white papers, finished products, and sometimes <a href="http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/06/15/llc.fqu026.abstract" target="_blank">honest discussions of a project's struggles</a>). But what does doing this work look like on a daily basis?  What tools do you use, and where, and when? <a href="http://mkirschenbaum.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/on-tradecraft-and-track-changes/" target="_blank">Matthew Kirschenbaum writes</a>:
<blockquote><span style="color: #888888;">Nobody teaches you how to write a book. Yes, in graduate school, you may get “feedback” on your dissertation to a greater or lesser extent from mentors and peers. But that typically has very little do with the process of executing on a marketable book project. (Kirschenbaum, <a href="http://mkirschenbaum.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/on-tradecraft-and-track-changes/" target="_blank">blog post</a>)</span></blockquote>
<a href="http://mkirschenbaum.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/on-tradecraft-and-track-changes/" target="_blank">Kirschenbaum's post</a> attempts to improve on this lack of example for how scholarly work gets done, discussing practical details of his book-writing process such as citation management. I've tried to emulate this example-sharing by blogging about my dissertational process, from the technical choices I've made to the theoretical questions I'm considering. In this post, I've asked myself what I'd like most like to learn about others' DH work set-up, and decided that the physical and screenspace environments, most-used software and websites, and work habits were the aspects I would most benefit from seeing other examples of. I'll describe the workplace set-up, schedule, and software that help me make progress on my <a title="Digital Dissertation" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/digital-dissertation/" target="_blank"><em>Infinite Ulysses</em></a> project, with the hope of hearing more from others about the day-to-day environment and behavior that produces their digital humanities work.
<h1>Workspace</h1>
<strong>MITH. </strong>I'm in residence at MITH as the <a href="http://mith.umd.edu/mith-welcomes-amanda-visconti-as-winnemore-fellow/" target="_blank">Winnemore Digital Dissertation Fellow</a> this academic year, and the plan is to do most of my remaining dissertation work at the office. MITH is generally either quiet or has a pleasant hum, but sometimes I'll block out sounds while I'm blogging or on a particularly frustrating problem. I saved up for some noise-canceling headphones, which are pretty magical at producing quiet even when I've been trying to work in an airport. In the past, I've used cheaper but still useful alternatives such as earplugs or normal headphones playing free white noise. <a href="https://www.coffitivity.com/" target="_blank">Coffitivity</a> is great when you want want something a little more realistic in the background.

I use an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse, both for the extra screen space and to position everything at the optimum height for my wrists and neck.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3634" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_0571-1024x768.jpg" alt="A photo of my fellowship desk at MITH, Fall 2014." width="474" height="355" />

<strong>Home. </strong>I worked entirely at home over the summer, but my set-up there is pretty similar (external monitor, desk/chair/externals adjusted to promote good posture/happy muscles).

In terms of screen space usage, I'll have one Chrome browser window open with a number of tabs up (or two separate windows if I want to separate research/question-solving from website work), as well as a minimized Firefox window (for checking site design and script using the plugin Firebug). I'll also have a text editor open with several different code files I'm working on or consulting, and the GitHub for Mac application open for committing (saving/uploading) new code to my private dissertation code repository (to be made public soon).
<h1>Work schedule</h1>
<strong>Time. </strong>I have the most energy in the morning; I was the kind of person who preferred taking classes in the 8am slot during college. Being up early lets my day start at a slow pace, and I have a bit of time by myself to get into a good working frame of mind and plan what I want to accomplish that day.

I get to MITH a little before 8 A.M. and stay until I hit a good stopping point for the day, either mid- or late afternoon. I do this for four consecutive days a week, with some extra email/organization/reading work on those evenings after I go home and try to jog. On the remaining three days, I try to do nothing related to the dissertation, focusing instead on fun projects (creating a new theme for this blog, learning to bake really good bread, trying to increase my running distance, learning Go). So far, this is a great schedule: I get way more done than if I try to say "I should be working on my dissertation 40+ hours a week and on every single day!", and I'm always refreshed and excited to get back to my research after a few days resting my brain with other things. I think I'd allow myself to work on one of these days off if I was really excited, but I never want to feel like I need to; getting my project done a bit sooner isn't worth burning out or not being able to think about anything but my project.

<strong>Scheduling tasks.</strong> I previously used <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper" target="_blank">TaskPaper</a>, a task list app from the makers of the distraction-free writing app <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom" target="_blank">WriteRoom</a> (which really helped with writing my candidacy exam presentation!), to keep track of what I needed to do on my dissertation. That got a bit unwieldy. I've recently switched to keeping a TaskPaper list for things I want to do on non-dissertating days (so I can write them down and not have them distracting me), and using <a href="http://www.Basecamp.com" target="_blank">Basecamp</a> to manage teaching and research tasks. <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> is a good, free alternative, but I ended up finding the set-up for Basecamp matched the structure of my task list a bit better (I'm also more used to Basecamp from using it for MITH projects).

On Basecamp, I've attempted to break down everything I need to do in the remaining year (knock on wood) of my dissertation into small tasks, then added a date to the tasks I want to complete in the next month, so I can filter to a view of just what I need to accomplish today or this week in order to stay on track. Checking off tasks is pretty gratifying, and having a clear overview of what needs to be done by what point (after first, of course, creating a project timeline that I could reasonably follow, with a lot of empty buffer time at the end for all the things I can't plan for) keeps me from getting stressed about what I haven't done yet—if I complete the tasks I need to do this week this week, I know I'm on schedule.

Within a given week, I try to vary between coding-focused days and other activities such as organization of tasks and URL bookmarks, blogging, and reading/research. I generally start the week with coding so that if a problem proves frustrating, I can switch to a non-code day to clear my mind before trying to figure out the issue again.
<h1>Software</h1>
<strong>Citations. </strong>I've managed citations in the past with the free and awesome <a href="https://www.zotero.org/" target="_blank">Zotero</a> (e.g. for my master's thesis), and I expect to do so again once I start creating <a title="Designing a digital scholarly article" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2014/03/31/html5scholarlyarticle/" target="_blank">my final article about my project</a>. If you do a lot of your research on the Web, Zotero is fantastic—you can use it to pull citation info from a page you're reading, as well as take a snapshot of the page in case it disappears later.

Research for me right now means a mixture of theoretical articles (e.g. papers about the social reception of <em>Ulysses</em>, or studies on meaningful crowdsourcing for the humanities, or blog posts), example digital editions and other digital textual work (e.g. Alan Galey's <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/alangaley/visualizingvariation/index.html" target="_blank"><em>Visualizing Variation</em></a>), and support for my research coding/design (e.g. code snippets, the Drupal <a href="https://drupal.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">StackExchange</a>, tutorials, and documentation). I initially saved these bookmarks into various folders, but the folder names at the start of my project proved to be way too vague and all-encompassing two years down the road ("Scholarly Sources to Read", anyone?). I recently re-organized these so it's easier to find what I need, with more specific folder titles.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3636 " src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IUbookmarks.png" alt="Screenshot of Chrome bookmarks menu with folders for various dissertation topics" width="401" height="457" />

I wanted to keep the folders in a certain order, but kept losing that when I'd sort their contents by title—thus the numbering per folder. In my research resources folder, you can see some more specific sub-folders, such as one where I'm keeping track of the various digital edition and textual annotation tools I considered and tested before ending up working with Annotator.js.

<strong>Coding.</strong> I read, edit, and write code in <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/" target="_blank">bbEdit</a> (the pro version of the free <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/" target="_blank">TextWrangler</a>), which has far more fancy features than I can regularly use. Features I've found useful include scripts that convert minified CSS and JS into readable, well-structured code; folding (collapsing) sections of a code file I'm not working on and don't need to see; and searching across multiple folders.

<strong>Track changes. </strong>Keeping track of changes in my code is important for several reasons: I want to document effort for my dissertation committee (especially as my dissertation looks different than those they're used to), give proper credit and correct licensing for any pieces of open-source code I build on, and be able to roll back my code to an earlier state if I need to. I use <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">git</a> to do this, mostly through the website <a href="http://www.GitHub.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and a GUI app (<a href="https://mac.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub for Mac</a>) that is quicker for me than using git on the command line.

I've started creating <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/306267" target="_blank">Drupal installation profiles</a> after I make major changes to my work, so I can easily re-create my site without needing to reset all the options and reinstall various modules; eventually, I'll package all my work as a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/developing/distributions" target="_blank">Drupal distribution</a>, so that anyone can spin up a participatory digital edition website like mine with no more trouble than setting up a vanilla Drupal website (and if setting up a vanilla Drupal website is difficult or unknown to you, I'll provide user-friendly instructions on that as well—or you can check out Quinn Dombrowski's awesome <a href="http://drupal.forhumanists.org/" target="_blank"><em>Drupal for Humanists</em></a>).

<strong>Command line and local work. </strong>I don't use the command line as much when I'm just working locally (i.e. on a version of the website that lives on my computer and isn't accessible on the Web), and I've been mostly working locally lately. When I need it, I use Mac's Terminal app to manage things that are easier to do from the command line than via the GUI, such as <a href="https://github.com/drush-ops/drush" target="_blank">Drush</a> (a set of commands that makes doing sysadminy and developer things with a Drupal site quick), or to move files around. When I'm working on a site on the Web, I use the command line to install things, edit files, and more. When I want to work locally on my Drupal site, I use <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/" target="_blank">MAMP Pro</a> (the paid version of the free MAMP), which imitates the things I'd be using on a web server to make a Drupal site work (e.g. MySQL).

<strong>Technical support. </strong>An important piece of tacit understanding we discussed at <a href="http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/" target="_blank">Speaking in Code</a> was the ability to successfully search for answers to technical problems; surprisingly, knowing how to Google well as a coder—especially when technical words have alternative popular meanings—is a difficult skill to impart. Since someone has probably encountered the same or a similar problem to yours before and written about it, and coding today is all about not re-inventing the wheel but building off of existing open-source code, knowing how to search for what you need is a vital technical skill.

I've been working on some of the core functionalities of my Drupal site lately (things related to highlighting and annotating text in a digital edition), so my main searches have to do with Drupal, PHP (which Drupal is largely written in), and Javascript (the core functionality of my site is provided by Annotator.js). Besides pure Googling when I hit an obstacle, I visit the Drupal.org module pages for <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/annotator" target="_blank">Annotator</a> and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/annotation" target="_blank">Annotation</a> as well as their <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/annotator?categories=All" target="_blank">issue</a> <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/annotation?categories=All" target="_blank">queues</a> (to see if anyone else has run into the same issue), and the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>,  <a href="https://drupal.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">Drupal Answers</a>, and <a href="http://serverfault.com/" target="_blank">Server Fault</a> Q&amp;A sites. I'm also on the Annotator.js list-serv, which is fairly low traffic and offers a mix of news about the community of Annotator users/developers, and developer questions.

<strong>Blogging. </strong>I've covered how I figured out what I needed to blog about in <a title="Affinity of ideas: Using an affinity wall to map out my digital dissertation" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2014/04/28/affinitywallarticle/">this post on affinity mapping</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The core functionality of my website is the ability to highlight pieces of the Ulysses text and leave annotations on them (questions/answers, interpretations, contextualizations, notes); to achieve this, I'm building off <a href="http://annotatorjs.org/" target="_blank">Annotator.js</a>—Javascript code that lets you do what I just described, with a variety of plugin code that lets you add neat features like a heatmap of where the most annotations appear on a text (e.g. on what pages did readers have the most questions? what pages had the most contentious interpretations?). Since the site itself is built with Drupal, I'm using the Drupal modules already built to let Annotator.js work with, for example, Drupal's database as the place to store readers' annotations.
<h1>Not as easy as it sounded (is it ever?)</h1>
[caption id="attachment_3642" align="alignleft" width="225"]<img class="wp-image-3642 size-medium" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_0564-e1410265715355-225x300.jpg" alt="That the Drupal log under the skull and crossbones." width="225" height="300" /> That's the Drupal logo under the skull and crossbones. This was on my home dry-erase board for a while...[/caption]

My original project plan was to spend a lot of time coding the look and behavior of the reading interface, with the site functionality not re-inventing various wheels, but instead making connections among existing sets of code that allow textual annotation and social commentary, voting, ranking, etc. In practice, the existing Drupal-module versions of Annotator.js are buggy. Two big examples (for me):
<ul>
	<li>the Drupal Annotation modules (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/annotation" target="_blank">Annotation</a> and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/annotator" target="_blank">Annotator</a>) don't store tags added to annotations, so any tags added by a reader disappear forever on refreshing or changing the page (and tags really need to be treated as entities in their own right, and tied into the core Drupal taxonomy); and</li>
	<li>the code that sets up an individual textual annotation to be an "entity" (a Drupal type of content—such as a blog post, book page, or comment—that other existing Drupal modules automatically know how to act on) isn't completely working either (e.g. you can't add fields—such as a field to add tags to an annotation, fixing the tag storage problem—with the current code).</li>
</ul>
Having everything <em>not</em> go as smoothly as planned was actually great, though! I had a realistic goal in terms of what I needed to get done by the end of the summer to stay on track (have the site's main functions almost all working, ready to be completely finished at the end of September), and I wasn't worried about doing different work than expected to achieve those goals. Having the Drupal annotation modules need more work than expected meant I got to spend the summer trying various things to solve these issues, and learning a lot in consequence—like creating non-basic custom Drupal entities.

For example, I learned how to make a custom entity fieldable (able to have fields, like a place where you can add tags and have them autocomplete if they match existing tags) and add some fields to it, both by writing code ("programmatically") as well as via the Drupal admin interface (after making the annotation visible to the core Field UI module). I also read through the Annotator code so many times that I became much more comfortable with it, so I'll be able to augment it in the future far more easily.

In the end, it looks like I'll be building off the code fix created by another DH developer who was kind enough to start an online conversation with me about our mutual work improving textual annotation in Drupal (more on that project once they've decided to make their code public). I went back and forth about whether I wanted to build off their solution or keep hacking at my own, but in the end I hadn't been expecting to need to make those code fixes in the first place, so I decided I'd keep my remaining coding time this year free for expected work with the actual reading interface, like making a heatmap of the annotations and porting other existing Javascript/Coffeescript plugins to work with the Drupal version of Annotator.

<strong>Patching. </strong>I submitted an <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2329271" target="_blank">extremely simple patch</a> to the Drupal Annotation module (fixing a misspelled variable) as a way of learning the process; my patch was accepted into the module. Now I know how to create patches when I want to share further work with others using Drupal Annotation.

<strong>Installation profiles. </strong>I'm currently working on two separate local versions of the Infinite Ulysses website: one to work on improving the Annotation function code, and one for work on everything else (e.g. user profiles, site content, theming). As I work on the site's annotation abilities, I fairly often want to reinstall the site as a slightly quicker alternative to weeding all the references to annotation code out of the database (I should set up uninstall hooks to do this for me eventually...), or to see whether the code works correctly when installing the modules into a new site. Keeping the annotation work on a separate site lets me do this without losing my other work on the site.

But! I don't want to start from a standard Drupal blank site every time I need to reinstall my annotation code; I want a sample page of Ulysses to test the code on, user permissions already set up, modules installed, and various other things configured that I'd rather not do manually every time I reinstall the site. <a href="https://www.drupal.org/developing/distributions" target="_blank">Installation profiles</a> are a way to avoid starting from square one with a Drupal site, instead automatically pre-configuring the site as you'd like it to be (think of it like a module that tells the site to configure and install things a certain way during the site installation process). When I visit install.php, I now have a "Infinite Ulysses Pop-Up" option in addition to standard or minimal Drupal installations. Eventually, this profile will turn into a distribution, such that anyone can use it to install a Drupal site pre-configured to act as a participatory digital edition.

<strong>Annotation sidebar. </strong>The Annotator.js code I'm working with displays annotations as pop-ups hovering over the text, but from experience with my <a href="http://www.UlyssesUlysses.com" target="_blank">UlyssesUlysses</a> prototype and usability research, I prefer having annotations authored and displayed in a sidebar. This will also be handy for the tablet version of the website, as you'll be able to slide the annotation sidebar off and on the page like a drawer. I've been playing around with a couple ways of achieving this: modifying <a href="https://github.com/habeanf/annotator/blob/master/src/plugin/marginviewer.coffee" target="_blank">this existing CoffeeScript</a> or <a href="https://github.com/albertjuhe/annotator_view" target="_blank">this extension of that code</a> (<a href="http://ec2-54-191-181-65.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3060/annotation/mary/demo.html" target="_blank">demo'd here</a>) to work with Drupal, creating the sidebar by resetting the current CSS on annotation pop-ups and styling them into a sidebar, or a tactic such as <a href="https://github.com/artaphis/annotator_comments" target="_blank">this repo</a> which purports to display annotations as Drupal comments.

<strong>Book-page styling.</strong> I've been vacillating a bit as to the final display structure of the novel: I'm pretty sure I either want to have one page per chapter of the book and infinite scroll to put all the text of a chapter on one page, or have separate pages to match up with each page of the 1922 text of the novel (which I'm using). This is something I might end up doing A/B testing on, showing the text to some visitors one way and to other visitors the other way, and comparing their reactions and stats such as time spent on the site. Here are some questions I'll need whatever solution I use to address:
<ul>
	<li>How many annotations can load on a page at a time? How does this limit or non-limit affect site speed?</li>
	<li>How do annotations load on a very long page that only loads partial sections of the text at a time (when they're scrolled to, i.e. infinite scroll)?</li>
	<li>How will bookmarking on the site work—will a reader's last visited <em>and</em> furthest page in the book be marked as where they should start next, or will users have the option (or necessity) to bookmark one or more pages themselves?</li>
	<li>If I do offer one long scrolling webpage per chapter of the novel, can I easily generate bookmarks that jump a reader down to the last line they were reading?</li>
	<li>What other ways can users chart their progress through the book, such as badges per chapter, or a progress bar for pages read?</li>
	<li>What if readers want to read it out of order, or only some parts online (and mark parts they read offline as completed)? What if they want to glance ahead without losing the bookmark at where they actually want to pick up reading next?</li>
</ul>
<strong>Long-term thinking.</strong> I met with the artist and IP lawyer behind the excellent web/iPad comic of Ulysses (<a href="http://www.ulyssesseen.com" target="_blank">Ulysses Seen</a>). We're all keenly interested in opening Ulysses to more public reading and conversation; they want a way for comic readers to be able to jump from the comic to the text, and I'm also interested in supporting the comic's readers in enjoying the text—so we've been discussing combining our websites into one super-accessible, textual <em>and</em> visual Ulysses edition, after I've defended my dissertation. This is also a good way for me to think about how I'll manage hosting costs and moderation effort in the future.

<strong>Other summer activities</strong> included lots of reading (as much as I read, I'm always adding more links to my reading list every time I go on Twitter), researching the social modules I want to use on annotations, and drafting site content. In particular, I've been looking into how existing communities (especially online ones where people submit text and/or converse) have succeeded in building friendly spaces, self-moderating, creating community guidelines, and fostering an inclusive and welcoming atmosphere.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">Has anyone ever managed to get the type of website feedback they requested? How do you do it? I tend to get grammar, grammar, and typos.

— Rachel Donahue (@sheepeeh) <a href="https://twitter.com/sheepeeh/status/497374716189872128">August 7, 2014</a></blockquote>
I've been thinking about specific questions I want to ask during the user testing for <a title="Digital Dissertation" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/digital-dissertation/">Infinite Ulysses</a> (my dissertation project)—more specifically, Rachel's tweet had me thinking about how to describe to user-testing volunteers what kind of feedback I'm seeking.  I came up with some statements that model the types of thoughts users might have that I'd like to know about. For the first phase of beta-testing on my project, I'll ask testers some abbreviated form of:
<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script>

<strong><i>Have one of the following thoughts, or similar? Please elaborate:</i></strong>
<ol>
	<li>"I wanted to see ___ but didn't / couldn't locate it / stopped looking for it even though it's probably there"</li>
	<li>"This is broken"</li>
	<li>"This is cool"</li>
	<li>"This could be done better (by ___?)"</li>
	<li>"This doesn't work how I expected (and that is good / bad /should be changed ___ way)"</li>
	<li>"Where is ___ again (that I used before"</li>
	<li>"This requires too many steps / is hard to remember how to use"</li>
	<li>"Don't see how / why I'd use this"</li>
	<li>"I'd use this ___ way in my reading / teaching / work"</li>
	<li>"I gave up (where, when)"</li>
	<li>"____ would make me like this site / like it better / use it regularly"</li>
	<li>"I'm not interested in <i>Ulysses</i>, but I'd like to use this interface for a different novel / non-fiction text / (other thing)"</li>
	<li>"Starting to read the text on the site took too long (too much to learn / too much text or instruction to wade through) / took the right amount of time (intro text and instruction was appreciated or easily skippable, or site use was intuitive enough to get started)</li>
	<li>"I would recommend this site (to x person or y type of person)"</li>
	<li>"The problem with this site is ___"</li>
	<li>"Reading on this site would be easier if ___"</li>
	<li>"I wish you'd add ___"</li>
</ol>
<h1>Testing stages for <a title="Digital Dissertation" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/digital-dissertation/" target="_blank">Infinite Ulysses</a></h1>
As I start to get all my design and code ducks in a row for this project this month, I'll be moving into a cycle of user-testing and improving the website in response to user feedback. I'll be testing in four chunks:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Self-testing:</strong> Working through the site on my own to locate any really obvious issues; for example, I'll step through the entire process of signing up and reading a chapter on the website to look for problems. I'll step through the site with <a title="Infinite Ulysses: Usability Personas and Site Content Ideas" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2013/12/12/iuusabilitypersonasandsitecontent/" target="_blank">different user personas in mind</a> (imitating the different backgrounds and needs of some of my target audiences, such as first-time readers of <em>Ulysses</em> and teachers using the site with a class). I'll also apply various website assessment tools such as validators for code and accessibility.</li>
	<li><strong>Alpha testing:</strong> Next, I'll run some low-stakes testing by inviting my dissertation committee, close friends, and family to break the site. This might get me to a point where the next stage of testers aren't hitting any problems big enough to take the site down or make testers wait while I take days to fix a difficult issue.</li>
	<li><strong>Beta testing: </strong>I'll conduct beta-testing this fall and spring by opening the site to exploration and use by the people who have generously volunteered <a href="http://goo.gl/qtcy6" target="_blank">via this sign-up form</a>. <em>Phase I</em> will take place this fall and take feedback from volunteers using the site individually; <em>Phase II</em> will take place in winter and early spring, continuing individual use of the site, and adding in people using the site in groups, such as teachers with their classes, or book clubs reading together.</li>
	<li><strong>Post-release testing: </strong>I'll continue to take feedback once the site goes live for use by anyone in June 2015, although I'll need to scale down work on requested enhancements and focus on bug fixes and continued data gathering/analysis on how people use the site to read. Setting up site logging and Google Analytics on my site will help me monitor use as time allows.</li>
</ol>
<h1>User testing how?</h1>
I'll be building on my user-testing experience from my master's research and the <a title="Bitcurator: Digital Forensics in the Archive" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2013/08/26/bitcuratordigitalforensics/" target="_blank">BitCurator</a> project, as well as trying some new tactics.

The <a href="http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/71380" target="_blank">thesis for my information master's degree</a> involved a use study exploring how members of the public (and others with a content interest in a website, but lack of experience with digital humanities and edition/archives commonplaces) experienced scholar-focused DH sites, using the <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/" target="_blank"><em>Blake Archive</em></a> and <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/" target="_blank"><em>Whitman Archive</em></a> as examples. I was particularly interested in identifying small design and development changes that could be made to such sites to better welcome a public humanities audience. For my master's research, I built off existing user study metrics from a related field (learning technology) as well as creating and testing questions suggested by my research questions; feedback was gathered using a web survey, which produced both quantitative and qualitative data for coding and statistical analysis.

I'm hoping to further set up
<ul>
	<li>web surveys for willing site visitors to fill out after using the site</li>
	<li>shorter web pop-up questions—only for users who check a box agreeing to these—that ask quick questions about current site use (perhaps incentivized with special digital site badges, or with real stickers if I can get some funding for printing)</li>
	<li>in-person meetings with volunteers where I observe them interacting with the site, sometimes having them talk aloud to me, or with a partner, as to their reactions and questions as they use the site</li>
	<li>various automated ways of studying site use, such as Google Analytics and Drupal site logging</li>
</ul>
For bug reports and feature requests, site visitors will be able to send me feedback (either via email or a web form) or submit an issue to the project's GitHub repository. All bugs/enhancement feedback will become GitHub issues, but I don't want to make users create a GitHub account and/or figure out how to submit issues if they don't want to. I'll be able to add a label to each issue (bug, enhancement request, duplicate of another request, out of scope for finishing my dissertation but a good idea for some day, and won't fix for things I won't address and/or can't replicate). I'm using Zapier (a If This Then That -like service) to automate sending any issues labeled as bugs or enhancements that I want to fix before my dissertation defense to Basecamp, in an appropriate task list and with a "due in x days" deadline tacked on.

<h1>User testing for the long haul</h1>
I've got one major technical concern about this project (which I'll discuss in a later post), and one big research-design concern—both related to the "Infinite"-ness of this digital edition. My research design concern is the length of this user-testing; I'm pursuing this project as my doctoral dissertation, and as such I'm hoping to defend the project and receive my degree in a timely manner. Usability testing can be done over the course of a few months of users visiting the site and my iterating the design and code; testing use and usefulness, as in
<ol>
	<li>how people want to use the site (i.e. perhaps differently from how I imagined),</li>
	<li>how people read <em>Ulysses</em> (a long and complex book which, if you're not attempting it in a class or book club, might take you months to read), and</li>
	<li>what happens to a text like <em>Ulysses</em> as it accrues readers, their annotations, and the assessment the social modules lets readers place on others' annotations (the more readers and annotations, the more we can learn)</li>
</ol>
are things I can begin to gather data on, and begin to speculate on what trends that data suggests we'll see, but I won't be able to give them the full treatment of years of data gathering within the scope of the dissertation. To address this, I'll both analyze the data I do gather over the course of months of user testing, and try to automate further data-gathering on the site so that I can supplement that analysis every few months or years without requiring too much effort or funding to sustain this work.

		<title>Evaluating Non-Traditional Digital Humanities Dissertations</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Most of the online advice I've encountered for evaluating non-traditional scholarly projects seems to focus on seeking jobs or applying for tenure with a portfolio that is significantly digital; the process of translating that body of work for a reviewing committee matches up pretty well with how evaluation works for the dissertation defense process for a non-traditional and/or digital project (and I've covered some of these suggestions at the end of this post). Charting progress and recording effort throughout the non-traditional dissertation, though, is a mostly undiscussed topic.

Having a unique format scrubs a lot of the traditional methods for evaluating these factors: maybe there's no "chapter" to turn in, or you've undertaken a critical building project in a programming language your committee can't read (and even if your committee could read through the entire body of code you author, you wouldn't want them to need to—just as with a monograph project, you want to be respectful of mentors' time by asking for feedback at specific milestones and with some kind of concise artifact to assess).

My dissertation has a unique format—there's no monograph, and the bulk of the work is blogging, design, coding, user-testing, and analysis of testing data. I've come up with a comfortable set of practices that let me keep my dissertation committee updated and on-board with my expected outcomes, give me some handy accountability to produce a reasonable amount of weekly work, and clearly document my effort and progress in case administrators even request evidence of the equivalency of my research with that of students using a more time-tested format. This post will cover how I'm recording my progress and sharing recognizable milestones with my advisor and committee;  I use a combination of GitHub, Zapier (an IFTT-like service), Basecamp, scheduled emails, and GoogleDocs.
<h1>GitHub for evaluating any type of writing</h1>
I'm using GitHub to manage my code (more below), but it turns out GitHub has a lot of nifty ways for me to let my advisor and committee have a sense of my coding progress and effort—visualizations that would work just as well for someone using GitHub to track changes in their writing, for example. I've added my advisor as a collaborator on my dissertation code repository so that he can also see the progress charted there.

[caption id="attachment_3677" align="aligncenter" width="504"]<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/commits.png"><img class="wp-image-3677 size-full" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/commits.png" alt="List of commit messages for GitHub code" width="504" height="571" /></a> Example code commits give a summary of what the code I'm adding to the repository achieves (e.g. did it fix a specific bug? add a new feature?).[/caption]

Whether or not the text you're working with is code, GitHub lets you track frequency and quantity of work, and offers some nifty visualizations to give you an overview of your work habits. With a project where you're learning or advancing a technical skill, this can be a nice way of showing that even if something you spent two weeks on didn't pan out (e.g. I ended up not using my Islandora digital edition work), you were doing active work during that time.

GitHub visualization options include (note all examples are from a repo opened at the end of August):
<ul>
	<li>Viewing the number of code commits made by week:</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/commitsbyweek.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3672 size-full" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/commitsbyweek.png" alt="GitHub bar chart of code commits by week." width="194" height="161" /></a>
<ul>
	<li>Evaluating your work habits by showing a "punchcard" of what days of the week and times of day you commit the most code (mostly sticking to my commitment to not dissertate on weekends so far!):</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/punchcard.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3673 size-full" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/punchcard.png" alt="GitHub &quot;punchcard&quot; chart of code additions and deletions by day and time of day." width="933" height="522" /></a>
<ul>

<h1> GitHub for code tracking</h1>
<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sharedrepo.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3678" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sharedrepo-300x37.png" alt="sharedrepo" width="316" height="39" /></a>

[caption id="attachment_3679" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/myrepo.png"><img class="wp-image-3679 size-medium" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/myrepo-300x39.png" alt="myrepo" width="300" height="39" /></a> I'm managing my dissertation code via a completely private repository that regularly gets pulled into a private repository that only certain collaborators can view (sharing read-only code to only select people is slightly roundabout).[/caption]

I'm using GitHub to backup and track my coding work for all the regular webdev reasons (lots of copies keeps stuff safe, it will be easy to release code to the public when it's ready, etc.). Part of my deliverable work is good documentation of my coding, so I need to keep the repository README updated. (A repository, aka "repo", is the place on GitHub where my code is stored, which you can visit and view as webpages; a README is a text file sharing some information about that repo, visible at the bottom of the front page of a GitHub repository).

[caption id="attachment_3680" align="aligncenter" width="793"]<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/readme.png"><img class="wp-image-3680 size-full" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/readme.png" alt="Screenshot of the README file from my code repository." width="793" height="671" /></a> README file explaining what the code in the repository does/will do.[/caption]

I'm using the README in two ways:

My project focuses on creating and testing new interface abilities by building off existing wheels such as Drupal (for the site structure itself) and Annotator.js (for the core textual annotation functionality). Many of the terms of the various FOSS licenses on these code collections dictate that I attribute this work properly, but even without such licenses visible and detailed attribution would be extremely important to me. Everyone should get credit and thanks for sharing their work with others! (See the awesome "<a href="http://mcpress.media-commons.org/offthetracks/part-one-models-for-collaboration-career-paths-acquiring-institutional-support-and-transformation-in-the-field/a-collaboration/collaborators%E2%80%99-bill-of-rights/" target="_blank">Collaborators' Bill of Rights</a>" that came out of a MITH workshop for more on why correct credit should matter to everyone). Plus, making it clear that this project is founded on a variety of existing code sets might encourage others to think about platforms that could emerge from combining or augmenting existing code, giving us new tools and approaches instead of sinking time into reinventing wheels. Since I'll also be producing a lot of my own reusable code (plugins, interface), this page will also help me make it clear to future employers what pieces of code are authored by me.
<h1>Basecamp for project progress</h1>
Basecamp is a project management tool that also works well for teaching courses (<a href="https://basecamp.com/teachers" target="_blank">and it's free for teachers!</a>) or working on solo projects. Among other features, it lets you create various task lists containing tasks with due dates:

[caption id="attachment_3681" align="aligncenter" width="753"]<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/basecampexample.png"><img class="wp-image-3681 size-full" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/basecampexample.png" alt="Screenshot of tasks on a Basecamp task list" width="753" height="113" /></a> Some of the tasks in my Basecamp project; this list is helping me track what needs to be done before I start alpha-testing.[/caption]

Basecamp will also help me automatically turn feedback from user-testing into tasks on my dissertation to-do list, using <a href="http://Zapier.com" target="_blank">Zapier,</a> a service that connects various other internet services (e.g. get an email when one of your tweets is RT'd, and other <a href="https://ifttt.com" target="_blank">IFTTT</a>-like options).

[caption id="attachment_3682" align="aligncenter" width="928"]<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/zapier.png"><img class="wp-image-3682 size-full" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/zapier.png" alt="Screenshot of using Zapier to turn GitHub issues into Basecamp tasks" width="928" height="179" /></a> Using Zapier to create Basecamp tasks from GitHub issues.[/caption]

GitHub repositories allow people to create "issues", which are like comments on the code or software in the repository; I'll then place labels on these issues depending on what type of problem they represent: a bug, a feature request, or something out of scope for the dissertation project. Once issues get a label, they automatically appear on a Basecamp task-list as to-dos containing the text in the issue and assigning me a due date to address that issue in the next two weeks. You can get started similarly managing GitHub issues using this Zap by using <a href="http://zpr.io/G6Wv" target="_blank">the template I've shared</a>.

[caption id="attachment_3683" align="aligncenter" width="568"]<a href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/issues.png"><img class="wp-image-3683 size-full" src="http://www.literaturegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/issues.png" alt="Screenshot of issues in my GitHub repository" width="568" height="349" /></a> Some example issues on my GitHub repository; each issue automatically became a to-do with a due date on my Basecamp project after I labeled the issue, thanks to Zapier.[/caption]
<h1>Emails and GoogleDocs</h1>
I've scheduled myself to create a weekly email to my advisor covering three things:
<ol>
	<li>what I accomplished on the dissertation over the past week,</li>
	<li>what my goals were for the following week, and</li>
	<li>anything I needed him to do or read.</li>
</ol>
These emails are both useful in keeping my advisor up to date with my work and as a record of that progress, should we ever need to demonstrate it to university administration (although <a title="Five Tips for Getting Started on a Digital Humanities Dissertation" href="http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/10/21/startingadhdissertation/">I've gotten written consent for my unique dissertation format from the interested parties as described in this post</a>, so I'm not expecting to actually need these records). Weekly emails are also effective for me as a carrot and/or stick: I know I need to make some progress during the week or the email will be empty, and writing the email reminds me of all the things I got done in a week.

My four dissertation committee members have been awesomely willing to meet with me as a team. I've met with them all in the same room twice so far at milestones during my dissertation process (once while designing the dissertation and preparing the prospectus, and once when I was starting to have a good idea of what the final project deliverables would look like). We'll be meeting again in the next weeks as I finish site functionality and begin user-testing.

Meeting as a team has been a great way to make feedback into a conversation among several areas of expertise. It's also been great to reaffirm that the committee understands what the deliverables at the time of the defense will look like, and that they still find that outcome satisfies the requirements of a dissertation in my department. Once I find a meeting time that works for everyone, I send them an agenda for what I'll cover in the meeting; this helps me use their time wisely, as well as let them know the type of feedback I'm seeking or any questions I might need them to answer (e.g. I let them know I'd be checking if they still felt my deliverables worked as a full dissertation, so they can revisit my project beforehand and come to the meeting prepared with any questions or concerns). To make getting prepared for the meeting easier, I'll also share a GoogleDoc highlighting what I've accomplished since our last meeting; how my project, timeline, or expected deliverables have changed (if at all); and a list of linked titles for the blogs I've published since the last meeting.
<h1>Evaluation at the end of the dissertation</h1>
That's how I'm tracking my work throughout the dissertation, but how do you establish when a non-traditional dissertation fulfills the normal checks on dissertation completion—has the project demonstrated the ability to design and pursue a scholarly research project at the doctoral level? If you parallel the dissertation with the tenure-application process, you increase the amount of available reading about digital humanities research evaluation. There are <a href="http://www.mla.org/guidelines_evaluation_digital" target="_blank">guidelines like the MLA's</a> for digital projects, the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities' resource page on "<a href="http://cdrh.unl.edu/articles/promotion" target="_blank">Promotion &amp; Tenure Criteria for Assessing Digital Research in the Humanities</a>", and the <a href="http://digitalhumanities.unc.edu/resources/valuing-evaluating-dh-practice/" target="_blank">Carolina Digital Humanities Initiative's resource page</a> on "Valuing and Evaluating DH Practice". Digital humanities scholars who seek tenure are publicly blogging about their <a href="http://quintessenceofham.org/2013/02/07/a-digital-humanities-tenure-case-part-2-letters-and-committees/" target="_blank">experiences</a> more often, and tips about packaging for tenure review blog posts, tweets, and other examples of scholarly public engagement are frequent among digital humanists on Twitter. Just as tenure applications are starting to include ways scholars have engaged the public, keeping track of online reactions to your project (blog post reading stats, Twitter comments, and RTs for tweets about your dissertation) can serve as a testament to the meaningfulness of your research and dissertation format, as well as offer a kind of shallow mid-stage peer review (thinking along the lines of: retweets of links to posts about your project may be an extremely mild and imprecise form of peer review).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>As I'm headed into alpha testing the Infinite Ulysses digital edition in a few weeks, I want to be better at recoding here the types of questions I'm addressing in my day-to-day code and design work.</div>
<div>

&nbsp;
<h1>Is this scholarly work?</h1>
Scholarly developer Patrick Murray-John has <a href="http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-1/theory-digital-humanities-and-noticing-by-patrick-murray-john/" target="_blank">a great piece in the <i>Journal of Digital Humanities</i></a> on

</div>
<div>Omeka digital archive: what is an "item"? what is a "collection"?</div>
<div>

&nbsp;

I find that a lot of the quibbles about the scholarly nature of these sorts of technical decisions come down not to tensions between the digital and non-digital, but between the focus of literary studies on capital-T Theory and the more marginal focus on textual studies within literary studies (marginal might not be the best word; certainly textual studies have become more integrated into literary academic departments and thinking over the past few decades, but there was a point at which studies of the material book and the textual scholarship of scholarly editing were by many set quite apart from critical literary work).

Some definitions might help (though note these are just my impressions of fields and not official mandates on what gets to call itself what)
Textual studies is
Textual scholarship
My Infinite Ulysses project, like most of my work, is interdisciplinary. My doctoral studies are based in a Literature Department,
recognizably "literary studies" research questions

I've had to pare off some interesting questions about critical digital design and the material book in order to keep this project in scope for a dissertation

interface
modeling and studying reading and book-conversation practice: "scaffold" to support expected and/or recommended behavior, and improving design in response to observed behavior and emergent uses not previously imagined/predicted

backgrounds (master's from a school of information, professional web design/development)

These questions are both technical (how would I implement this? what's the most concise, secure, speedy way to implement this? can I implement this in a reasonable amount of time with my current technical skills?) and theoretical—the look and behavior of the interface models how users will read the novel on my site (including predicting+scaffolding, and testing/responding to how people read digital text, how people read text with participatory/social apparatus, how people read complex texts, how people read encyclopedic Modernist novels, how people read Ulysses).

The following thoughts about designing/coding bookmarks, reading progress trackers, and page layout for my Infinite Ulysses digital edition are the nitty-gritty of this scholarly work with reading practices and interfaces for literary texts. Remember too that after I make my choices, implement them via code, user-test them with real readers of <em>Ulysses</em>, and improve the site design to better serve those readers, I'll be writing a critical narrative of this progress in my scholarly article draft (think of the "results" and "conclusion" and "discussion" sections from a social science or science paper for a literary parallel).
<h1>Bookmarks, reading progress, page layout</h1>
Default: user proceeds sequentially through the book (page 1, then 2, then 3) and expects site to bookmark their place as last page read

</div>
<div>Complications: desire to read on site non-sequentially (only reading certain episodes for a class, only desiring help with the more difficult later episodes in the book, need to look back at an earlier thing they read or want to peek ahead)</div>
<div></div>
<div>progress bar options: sequential reading (you've completed range of pages 1 through page x) or total read pages (you've read x of y total book pages on this site)</div>
<div>bookmarking (manual, automatic): reasonable for user to want site to save the last page they visited in the book (auto-flagging), but that's complicated by the behaviors above; can have instead or additional user-set bookmark (perhaps with alert when visiting page out of order to ask if should change bookmark?)</div>
<div></div>
<div>these feed into decision about page layout:</div>
<div>infinite scroll page of whole book (slower site if can't finesse what loads when correctly; scroll navigation mistakes from too-hearty flip gesture on tablet)</div>
<div>infinite scroll page for each episode</div>
<div>page for each paper page (allows syncing with reading in print edition if you have the correct edition; might also give general guidelines of how digital episode beginning page matches to episode beginning page for various print editions)</div>
<div></div>
<div>The determining factor may be that because of how Annotator is aware of where annotations are on a web page (they currently can sort in the order of when they were placed on the text, but not in the actual order of how you'd encounter them when reading word by word through the text; would require extra coding), I might want to limit how much text the annotations on a given webpage can refer to (i.e. create a web page per page in the Ulysses print edition I'm using).</div>
<div></div>
<div>I've been searching for examples of infinite scroll + Drupal + bookmarking, and I have the backup plan of replicating each page of the 1922 Ulysses text as a webpage, which would make bookmarking easy. It's going to be a bit of a battle between what seems to be best in terms of how people read vs. what I'm able to code—if possible, this would be a neat thing to do some A/B testing on (do it one way for some viewers and the other for other viewers, and compare how they rated the site and how much time they spent on the site). And people might have different preferences depending on whether they're reading on a desktop/laptop or tablet—I worry that infinite scroll on tablets makes it too easy to lose your place. Whatever I decide, it's an interesting problem for making digital editions readable, so I'll do a blog post laying out the different options and why I chose whatever I choose.</div>]]></content:encoded>
